So I worked on a few ideas, but obviously mols2grid was designed to work inside Jupyter Notebook/Lab and Shiny for Python was only out of alpha at that stage so things were still being developed. After a few trials, unfortunately mols2grid wasn't directly compatible with the Shiny for Python framework at that time (I even wrote a small story about it - link). \n\nI then went away to work on another project on molecular scaffolds and left this mini project aside. However, recently I had another idea of trying to build a Shiny for Python app from the scratch (with a focus on cheminformatics or chemical information), so that users in relevant fields can view and save 2D images of small molecules in a web browser environment instead of only inside a Jupyter Notebook/Lab. I also thought to place the Shiny for Python framework to test if it was being used in a more intensive area such as chemistry and drug discovery.\n\nAnother reason that have triggered this side project was that I came across a comment from an old RDKit blog post from someone asking about how to save compound image as a PNG file, since SVG version was hard to convert etc. (or something along that line). I thought it should be possible, and this should not be only limited to Jupyter environments only (thinking of people not doing coding at all...), so here we are.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **About each version of the app**\n\nI'll try to explain what each version of the app_x.py script entails, as there are currently several different versions of them inside the repository. The final version is the one called \"app.py\", named this way so that it'll be recognised by rsconnect/Shinyapps.io when deploying the app. By providing some explanations below should also show that it was quite a process to arrive at the final \"app.py\", it wasn't built within a day for sure (at least for me).\n\n###### **app_x.py**\n\nExplanations/features\n\n###### **app_x.py**\n\nExplanations/features\n\n###### **app_x.py**\n\nExplanations/features\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Other files**\n\n###### **code_test.py**\n\nI'm not sure exactly how other data scientists/developers work, but for me since I came from a completely different background and training, I'm used to plan, set up and do experiments to test things I'd like to try, and see where the results will lead me to. So for this in a virtual computer setting, I use the \"code_tests.py\" to test a lot of different code. If you go into this file, then you'll likely see a lot of RDKit code trials, and I have had a lot of fun doing this since I get to see the results right away when running the code, and learning new code functions that way. If the end result is not the one I've intended, I go on short journeys to look for answers (surprisingly I didn't use any generative AI chatbots along the way actually), it'll mainly be chosen intuitively as I search online, but I can for this particular project, a lot of it was past RDKit blogs, StackOverflow and random snippets I came across that have given me ideas about solving a particular issue.\n\n<br>\n\n###### **app_table.py & app_itables.py**\n\nThese two as the file names have suggested were trials for incorporating dataframe inside a web app. The difference was that app_table.py was purely a data table being presented inside the app, without any other particular features, while app_itables.py utilised a different package itables that provided an interactive feature to search for data in rows. The previous post on data source used for this app or interactive data table was embedded inside a Quarto document, the same principle would also apply to the table being present inside a Jupyter notebook environment (?Lab as well).\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Features of the app**\n\nComments from scripts available - check.\n\nMainly for viewing, saving and substructure highlighting of target molecules.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **App deployment**\n\nTwo places I've tried so far - HuggingFace and Shinyapps.io. \n\nIssue with cairosvg code when deploying on HuggingFace.\n\nDeploying to Shinyapps.io wasn't a smooth ride as well - some problems initially. Explain the steps.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Further improvements of the app**\n\nMay be useful to add a download option for real-world use case, but for demonstration purpose, I'm leaving it as a \"View\" only for now, unless I get comments from readers that they'd like to try this. For localhost version (e.g. if operating from an IDE such as VS Code), the saving image function should work and the files will be saved into the working directory.\n\nIt may be even better to use SMARTS or SMILES for highlighting compound substructures actually. I'm using atom indices as I'm using a specific code in RDKit, but perhaps more experienced people with RDKit will know how to add other alternative options.\n\nThe app layout may be further optimised e.g. interactive data table could be placed at a different location.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Final words**\n\nThe whole idea behind this mini side project was to show that interested users could use this web app framework to build an interactive app using their own data. Other useful web app frameworks are also available and definitely not limited to the one I'm using here (I'm simply trying to test it out since it's relatively new comparing to others). In a drug discovery and development setting, this could be useful to make non-coding parties understand where the computer side is trying to do, and to help them during their lab experimental workflows, hoping to add some convenience at least.\n\n",
