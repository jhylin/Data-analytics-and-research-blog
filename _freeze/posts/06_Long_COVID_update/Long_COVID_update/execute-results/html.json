This time the dataset was obtained from another journal paper, which had data collected until July 2021 (the previous paper was only until March 2021). I've used Python to extract a table from the PDF of the paper and also Excel to assist with data cleaning. This was followed by using R to analyse and visualise all the data.\n\n#### **Source of dataset**\n\nJournal paper by Healey Q, Sheikh A, Daines L, Vasileiou E. Symptoms and signs of long COVID: A rapid review and meta-analysis. J Glob Health 2022;12:05014. *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License*\n\n#### **Data scraping from PDF**\n\nThe dataset was scraped from a PDF obtained via PubMed (journal paper source as shown above) by using tabula-py (*for details please see this post, \"[Table scraping from PDF](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/6.%20Long%20COVID%20update/ExtractTableFromPDF.html)\"*). Unfortunately I had trouble installing a similar R package remotely after it was archived (tabulizer package with known issues in its GitHub repository) so I trialled tabula-py instead. It worked for scraping all the data from the target table, but the downside was that the scraped data did not inherit the original tabular format on PDF, with columns and rows all jumbled. I've discussed a little bit more on the likely reason for this in the blog post link above. So in short, the final scraped table was cleaned in Excel and saved as .csv file, which was then imported as shown below.\n\n#### **Data inspection and wrangling**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Uncomment below if requiring installations of packages\n# install.packages(\"wordcloud\")\n# install.packages(\"RColorBrewer\")\n# install.packages(\"tidytext\")\n# install.packages(\"leaflet\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLoading all the required libraries below.

Obviously since I was still quite new to R (started using R in July), I soon ran into a problem as I kept on getting stuck with not having the count() function to actually count unique elements under the co-morbidities column.\n\nBy looking at the magnified circle on the right in the image below, you would notice a subtle difference in spacing, so yes the culprit was the **space**[^1] and once it was removed, count() worked nicely as how it should be. One small downside was that it would also remove the space between the co-morbidity terms e.g. \"liver disease\" became \"liverdisease\", but since it achieved the aim intended to do unique counts on all the co-morbidities, I left it as it was.\n\n[^1]: It took probably at least half an hour to figure this out... eventually I thought to look at the column itself long enough to see if I'd missed anything... then voila!\n\n![Screenshot of the extra space(s) in dataframe](Zoom-in%20shot.jpg)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_new %>% \n  # Remove % symbol, numbers and don't forget to remove spaces as well in the column! \n  mutate(Comorbidities = str_remove_all(Comorbidities, \"[:digit:]|[%]|[ ]\")) %>%\n  # Add this line to filter out all the \"NA\"s\n  filter(!is.na(Comorbidities)) %>% \n  # Count the comorbidities in descending order\n  count(Comorbidities, sort = TRUE) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 37 × 2\n   Comorbidities     n\n   <chr>         <int>\n 1 diabetes         14\n 2 hypertension     13\n 3 IHD              10\n 4 asthma            9\n 5 COPD              9\n 6 obesity           9\n 7 CKD               6\n 8 malignancy        5\n 9 dyslipidaemia     4\n10 liverdisease      4\n# … with 27 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we could observe the top 3 frequency of all co-morbidities listed were: diabetes, hypertension and IHD[^2]. These were followed by, unsurprisingly, common respiratory illnesses such as asthma, COPD[^3], then obesity, and also CKD[^4], malignancy, dyslipidaemia and so on. These would be considered as high risk factors of developing long COVID symptoms if someone had these co-morbidities present before being infected by the coronoviruses.\n\n[^2]: ischaemic heart disease\n\n[^3]: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\n[^4]: chronic kidney disease\n\n#### **Data visualisations**\n\n##### **Bar graph for hospitalisation rate**\n\nThen a line of code to filter out the results of \"NA\" under the column of Hospital (%) was added. Most of the cells with \"NA\" were there to fill the multiple empty row entries for other variables and not for the Hospital (%) column, therefore these \"NA\"s were removed in this instance. The horizontal bar graph below showed the COVID-19 hospitalisation rate for studies in different countries, presenting a very diverse results between 0% and 100% hospitalisations across all 19 cohort studies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_hosp_icu %>% \n  # filter out all NAs\n  filter(!is.na(`Hospital (%)`)) %>% \n  # plot the bar graph\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Author (country)`, y = `Hospital (%)`)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![COVID-19 hospitalisation rate across different countries](Long_COVID_update_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Note*: two of the studies were removed from above, these studies were by Chiesa-Estomba (Italy) and Mahmud (Bangladesh), which had \"Not stated\" recorded under Hospital (%) {ICU (%)} column. When the Hospital (%) column was converted from character to numeric, these two rows were converted to \"NA\" automatically.\n\n##### **Interactive map for long COVID results**\n\n###### **Preparing dataframe for map**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_new_a <- df %>% \n  #

So after trialling the map visualisation several times, I opted to use centroids of each country instead, to leave the map in a cleaner and easy-to-see state. Otherwise one of the maps I tested before ended up with countless blobs of circles marking the boundaries of each country, looking like a 5-year-old's map drawing!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

frequencies in a set of texts. Nevertheless, it was one of the ways to get a rough idea about the most common terms cropping up in collected texts. This last part was more like a small exercise for me and also for anyone who might want to try this but did not where to start.\n\n#### **Summary**\n\nLong COVID had shown a very versatile and diverse range of signs and symptoms, often resembling other known post-viral illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome, the interactive map above would enable readers to see specific long COVID symptoms for selected countries. People with diabetes, hypertension and IHD might have higher risk of suffering from long COVID if they were infected with the coronoviruses. The types of co-morbidities were not limited to these three unfortunately and several other chronic illnesses mentioned above might also contribute to similar risk. The most affected body systems in long COVID were in respiratory tract, ear, nose and throat areas, musculoskeletal parts, gastrointestinal tract and last, but not the least, neuropsychiatric systems which could bring fatigue and memory/concentration issue, or more widely known as the \"brain fog\". All of these outcomes also did not vary widely from earlier meta-analyses on long COVID, reiterating the wide health ramifications that COVID-19 could inflict upon global populations.\n\n##### **Acknowledgement**\n\nI have to thank several online resources when I was trying to build the interactive map. Most notably, I've adapted my code based on these two useful online resources:\n\n1.
