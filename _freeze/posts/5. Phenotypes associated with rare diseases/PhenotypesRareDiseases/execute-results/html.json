It contained 37 columns with 112,243 rows originally, which took quite a long time to load on RStudio (or could be due to my laptop capacity...). It loaded relatively faster on Jupyter notebook from Anaconda, so I then decided to clean it up first using Python[^1] there. Some columns were removed which reduced the total number of columns from 37 to 13, while not changing any of the rows at all. The columns were also renamed to make it easier to read.\n\n[^1]: Used only for initial data cleaning stage - please see this [GitHub link](https://github.com/jhylin/Portfolio-projects/blob/main/Phenotypes%20associated%20with%20rare%20diseases%20-%20initial%20data%20cleaning.ipynb) for details. R was used for the rest of the analysis\n\n### **Source of dataset**\n\nOrphadata: Free access data from Orphanet. © INSERM 1999.

So, here's the question: what are the most common rare disorders and their associated phenotypic features?\n\n[^2]: This work is under [CC BY-SA 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) if anyone is interested in exploring the dataset further\n\nTo answer it, let's observe the spread of the disorder groups and types first by formulating a contingency table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_type <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder group`,`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(Number = n())\ndf_type\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n# Groups:   Disorder group [3]\n   `Disorder group`    `Disorder type`                                    Number\n   <chr>               <chr>                                               <int>\n 1 Disorder            Biological anomaly                                     41\n 2 Disorder            Clinical syndrome                                     661\n 3 Disorder            Disease                                             57920\n 4 Disorder            Malformation syndrome                               37634\n 5 Disorder            Morphological anomaly                                2644\n 6 Disorder            Particular clinical situation in a disease or syn…    418\n 7 Group of disorders  Category                                              479\n 8 Group of disorders  Clinical group                                        952\n 9 Subtype of disorder Clinical subtype                                     7394\n10 Subtype of disorder Etiological subtype                                  4060\n11 Subtype of disorder Histopathological subtype                              40\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter a quick view on the column of \"Disorder group\", it mainly provided different disorder types a group label for each, which to a certain extent, was not necessary at this early stage.

\"Validation date\" in this context meant the dates when the annotations of HPO terms were made for each rare disorder, which were based on the source articles listed (as shown in the Source column).\n\nFirstly, I started with the \"Disease\" disorder type and singled out the year component from the Validation date column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_val_date <- df %>% \n  mutate(year = year(`Validation date`), label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)\ndf_val_date\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 112,243 × 16\n   Disorder gr…¹ Disor…² HPO d…³ Diagn…⁴

Interestingly, 2016 seemed to be the year for rare disorders to be annotated with the most phenotypic features (if referring back to the original dataset, each observation or row was present for a unique \"Preferred HPO term\" or phenotypic abnormality).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_val_date_d %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 49 rows containing non-finite values (stat_count).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](PhenotypesRareDiseases_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt was also worth noting that there were 49 rows of non-finite values excluded from the bar graph above.
