**ðŸŒŸWelcomeðŸŒŸ**

As my portfolio site evolves over time, there is an accentuated trend of more cheminformatics projects in drug discovery themes as my interests grow more and more in this area. My earlier work was more on healthcare data projects since I came from a pharmacy-heavy background, but experimental research soon followed. Next project in the pipeline: ML series 2.1 - decision tree. Hopefully this will be ready in September or October as I'm trying to incorporate as much as I can from the beginning till the end.
