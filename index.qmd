**ðŸŒŸWelcome to my portfolio siteðŸŒŸ**

As my portfolio blog evolves over time, my work somehow revolves around two main themes - cheminformatics or data science and healthcare data projects. I'm an enthusiast in both Python and R currently, with another little ambition to learn Rust further down the line. I've dipped my toes a little bit in Rust very lightly in the "Pills dataset series". My more recent work is on data science in chemistry and pharmaceutical-related topics with a focus on building Shiny applications in R and Python lately.
