**ðŸŒŸWelcome to my portfolio siteðŸŒŸ**

As my portfolio blog evolves over time, my work seems to revolve around cheminformatics or data science in pharmaceutical themes, with my earlier work more on healthcare data projects. I'm an enthusiast in both Python and R, with another interest to learn Rust in the far future as mastering Python and R takes endless time. I'm currently working and brainstorming on a molecular scaffolds project, which is slowly growing at the moment.
