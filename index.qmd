**ðŸŒŸWelcome to my portfolio siteðŸŒŸ**

As my portfolio blog evolves over time, my work seems to revolve around two main themes - cheminformatics or data science and healthcare data projects. I'm an enthusiast in both Python and R currently, with another little ambition to learn Rust further down the line (this is currently scheduled very far down the line as mastering Python and R is going to take endless time...). My more recent work is on data science in chemistry and pharmaceutical-related topics with the latest focus working and brainstorming on a molecular scaffolds project.
