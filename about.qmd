**About this blog**

I was initially trained as a pharmacist in New Zealand, and spent several years working in community and hospital pharmacies. Somehow life took me on a detour where I went down the path of doing postgraduate studies. The research mainly focussed on drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry involved, with numerous hours spent in chemistry (wet) and computer (dry) labs doing experiments. The research work happened in Australia, where I've also continued to work as a hospital pharmacist while working on the research projects. Reflecting back, it felt like my brain cells have gone through a major metamorphasis during those years, before I ended up with a MPhil and PhD.

I've then decided to return to New Zealand and the pandemic hit within a few months after, which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change. Subsequently, I discovered my more recent interests in the world of data science and analytics. This then led to this blog, which is really my portfolio, on data analytics work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical fields, as I came from these backgrounds with boundless interests. It'll also be another channel for me to write personal blog posts detailing my journey in data analytics.
