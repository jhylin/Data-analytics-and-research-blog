**About this blog**

I was initially trained as a pharmacist in New Zealand and my work then somehow sparked a detour for me to go into postgraduate studies, focussing on research in drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry involved (spent hours and hours in chemistry labs and computer labs for experiments). The research work happened in Australia, where I've also continued to work as a pharmacist while working on the research (think a lot of my brain cells have gone through a death and reborn process during those years, before I ended up with a MPhil and PhD). 

I've then decided to return to New Zealand and the pandemic hit, which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change as well. So another detour then followed where I discovered my more recent interests in the world of data science and analytics. This then subsequently led to this blog, which is really my portfolio, on data analytics work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical fields, as I came from these related backgrounds. It'll also, at random times, be another channel for me to write personal blog posts detailing my journey in data analytics.
