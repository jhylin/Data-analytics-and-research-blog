Personally, I was born in Taiwan but was raised in New Zealand since I was a young kid. Professionally, I started my career as a pharmacist in New Zealand, and spent several years working at community and hospital pharmacies, across metropolitan and rural areas. Somehow life took me on a detour afterward where I went down the path of doing postgraduate research studies in Australia. The research mainly focused on drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry used, and also the inevitable countless hours spent in chemistry and computer labs doing experiments. I've also continued to work as a hospital pharmacist while working on these research projects. I've definitely kept myself very busy during those years.

I then decided to return to New Zealand after my PhD ended and the pandemic hit towards the end of that year (2019), which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change. Subsequently, I discovered my more genuine interests in data science and analytics using software tools. This then led to this site, which was really my portfolio on cheminformatics and data science work in drug discovery and healthcare themes, as I came from these backgrounds with boundless interests.

I'm currently an enthusiast in both Python and R, with another interest to learn Rust in the far future as mastering both Python and R takes endless time. I'd love to collaborate with interested parties and I'm open to new work opportunities in the drug discovery-related areas (contact details as shown below).
