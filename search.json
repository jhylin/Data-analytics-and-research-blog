    "text": "SERCA project (details in a separate post as named)\nFilamenting temperature-sensitive Z protein project (also known as FtsZ project)\n\nFtsZ project was not a new project at the time, but rather a continuation from my previous predecessors in the lab group. Its primary focus was to look for other novel anti-bacterial hit compounds that were different from the ones that were already synthesised and tested in the group. This project was better than the SERCA project in a way that the collaborators were much easier to communicate with even though they were based in India. One down side was that because they’re based overseas, it did take a long time for the compound testing to happen and to have the results returned on time. However, overall, there were much more progress in this project which involved 3 main iterative stages:\nComputational work – involved molecular/homology modelling, virtual compound screening (compound size roughly in several 100,000s, please see below links for details) and compound selection for synthesis (using Schrödinger software mainly for this first stage of work)\nCompound synthesis – this was certainly the part that has painstakingly taken a lot of time in a chemistry lab out of my four years with many failures in between but with some successes in the end obviously…\nCompound testing – it was mainly done by our research collaborators After the completion of these two projects, I was less of a research newbie but I would still humbly call myself a junior researcher, considering how the field of drug discovery can have such an unfathomable depth and breadth…\n\nThe image above was taken literally when I packed up everything after I’ve completed my PhD, which was physically summed into this little box, but what I’ve gained from the journey was far bigger than this. The two hardcover books on the left hand side were my MPhil and PhD theses (potentially useful as treatment for insomnia due to their lengths and time required to read).\nPlease see below for full details of my PhD work1 and abstract with link to my PhD thesis:\nLink to PhD thesis (beware: very long)\nAbstract for these two projects:\nDrug discovery is one of the most challenging research fields that contributes to the birth of novel drugs for therapeutic use. Due to the complexity and intricate nature of the research, lengthy processes are involved in identifying potential hit molecules for a therapeutic target. To shorten the time required to reach the hit-to-lead stage, computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been used to expedite the process and reduce laboratory expenses. Common strategies used within CADD involve structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD). Both strategies were used extensively in two projects showing the complementarity of each strategy throughout the process. In this work, two separate drug discovery projects are detailed: Design, synthesis and molecular docking study of novel tetrahydrocurcumin analogues as potential sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA) inhibitors – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit candidate(s) targeting SERCA by using SBDD Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) as therapeutic target in ligand-based drug design – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit molecule(s) targeting FtsZ In the first project, homology modelling and virtual compound library screening were utilised as the SBDD methods to identify potential hit molecules for testing in P-type calcium ATPases such as SERCA. Preliminary results have found compound 20, an analogue of tetrahydrocurcumin, to show some SERCA inhibitory effect at 300µM based on a SERCA-specific calcium signalling assay performed via fluorometric imaging plate reader. Molecular docking study has also reflected this outcome with desirable ligand-protein binding energies found for 20 when compared with other tested ligands. Pharmacophore screening was used as the main LBDD method in the second project to identify probable hit candidates targeting FtsZ. Potential ligands were synthesised, and tested for antibacterial effect in Bacillus Subtilis strain 168 (Bs168) and Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R6 (SpnR6) cells. One of the tetrahydrocurcumin analogues, compound 4, was found to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 10 µM in Bs168 cells and ≤ 2 µM in spnR6 cells. The IC50 values for 4 were 9.1 ± 0.01 µM and 1 ± 0.01 µM in Bs168 and SpnR6 cells respectively. The MIC of 4 was found to be very similar to the MIC of compound 1, a known hit compound targeting against Bs168 cells. On the other hand, the MIC of 4 was lower than the MIC (> 64 µg/mL) of a well-known FtsZ inhibitor, PC190723, against S. pneumoniae. Subsequent molecular docking analyses were completed to evaluate the ligand-protein binding energies to correlate against the testing results. Both compounds 20 and 4 possess some structural similarities and differences that may confer their different effects in these protein targets, which render both with potentials to become the next lead molecules for future development.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI have attempted to communicate with both of my PhD supervisors and also our research collaborators to publish this work, but to no avail due to the severe restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 situation from the beginning of 2020 till now, a direct publication in a scientific journal is not going to happen any time soon so I thought to provide at least my part from my PhD time to showcase what I’ve done at least… The more glorified version will hopefully be published one day in the future since more results would follow and make the story more complete. Updates from 31/1/2022 – it appeared that my supervisors are in communications with our overseas research collaborators recently about the manuscript so there is a higher chance now that we may be able to publish this work towards the end of 2022 (fingers-crossed…)↩︎"

Other factors that might have contributed to higher risk of suffering from long COVID were people who were above 60-65 years old and also people who have multiple chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.

There should have been more communications if possible and perhaps we could’ve terminated the project earlier if needed so that we could allocate more time to work on other research project that better suited to the situation of our lab group. To have a closure for this project, I’ve written up a chapter about it in my PhD thesis to show what have been done and what other future work can be added if we have all the time and money in the world.\n Image: Rawpixel.com\nLink to MPhil thesis (beware: quite long)\nAbstract of this project:\nThe goal of this research project was to discover potential chemical compounds that could be further developed to become lead compounds to target secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1) and also sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The drug design process would need to be robust enough to ask the question; could a SERCA inhibitor be developed based on the drug design process involving molecular modelling, chemical synthesis and biological testing? If this first step was achieved then the next critical step was to design a SPCA1 inhibitor as SPCA1 was found to be highly involved in basal-like breast cancer. The potential lead compounds would then have the opportunity to become novel anti-cancer agents targeting basal-like breast cancer in this context. The ultimate aim was to widen the current therapeutic agents available for patients with basal-like subtype of breast cancer in the hope to further improve their quality of life and life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nthis was not a perfect example of drug discovery, I was a complete research newbie prior to this MPhil project and thinking back, I think I was far too ambitious…↩︎"

Luckily, I did get one helpful response and with a small number of likes so perhaps I’m not doing it entirely wrong (hopefully). My future plans will likely be trying to do a #TidyTuesday data visualisation and post whenever I can to learn and grow.\nI’ve also recently edited my rare disease drug projects in R and Python to add summaries of findings from these two projects so it’s easier for anyone to read, especially if there’s not really much time to go through long threads of codes in GitHub. I’m also currently working on another project in the rare diseases series on phenotypes associated with rare diseases from Orphanet. My plan at the moment is to use Python to clean the data (I’ve tried to load it in RStudio via a URL with XML file, it’s >4000 rows and taking quite a long time to run on my laptop, so will stick to Python on Anaconda as it has loaded a lot faster than RStudio, then perhaps once it’s cleaned, I’ll re-import it back into RStudio for analysis and visualisations)."

    "text": "Regarding to the postdoc job searching, this has made me ponder really hard about what sort of research I would really like to work on. As I’ve spent time preparing my CV, writing different cover letters, applying for different postdoc-related roles and also after being invited to five job interviews, I’ve decided that it was not quite enough about what I’ve done so far in Masters and PhD work… I’m still lacking some skills. I’ve also realised that I do not necessarily like the traditional academic postdoc work (discovered while and after I’ve applied for numerous postdoc posts in 2019) and also I’m more inclined to work on computational chemistry and cheminformatics side of research.\nAnother “elephant-in-the-room” issue was that it has been very difficult to publish a first-author paper from my PhD research work, due to the impact from the development of COVID-19 pandemic for the last two years (my overseas-based collaborators have been hit hard particularly and they were still working on part of the experiments until the first quarter of the year 2021) and hence probably this was the most likely the reason that I did not get final offers in some academic postdoc positions, due to the lack of first-author papers.\nBecause of all the issues and problems, I’ve still kept my old pharmacist job as my side job while I start on a new journey in learning data science. I’ve tested the water since 2019 and temporarily ceased the learning in 2020 due to the pandemic (I worked full-time in hospital which was also another unforgettable experience of course). From the last quarter of 2021, I’ve made up my mind to go full board with data science (as I can’t see my PhD research work being published any time soon so it’s time to consider a possible change in direction). I thought I’d like to learn about it systematically with some sort of logical structures in the course so that I can understand a basic full picture about it in a reasonably short time (I realise data science itself is a profound field) and if there are some sort of accreditations, this would be even better. This was also the sole reason why I started on Coursera’s IBM data science professional certificate in the last quarter of 2021. After learning more about it, I’ve realised how much it has overlapped with cheminformatics and my interests in both areas grew more and more as time goes.\nI have now completed the data science professional certificate, which consisted of a total of 10 courses with assessments, assignments and portfolios (certificates and/or IBM badges viewable from my LinkedIn profile). I have managed to finish the course within about 5 months (from mid-September 2021 till end of January 2022) while working part-time as a locum pharmacist. Although it’s not a perfect course, I think it reflects very nicely what the reality will be like when working as a data scientist or cheminformatician – imperfections in data sources, data analyses and presentations that need to be corrected or problems that need to be solved by looking for answers and working on possible solutions. I think it’s a useful course for newcomers who want to learn more about data science and also for the professionals who would like to refresh or reaffirm knowledge and skills (this is by no means a promotion about Coursera’s data science course but just a personal learning experience only, other course providers may equally provide similar experiences and I would encourage anyone who’s interested to look around and see what other courses are available)."

So, here’s the question: what are the most common rare disorders and their associated phenotypic features?\nTo answer it, let’s observe the spread of the disorder groups and types first by formulating a contingency table.\n\ndf_type <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder group`,`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(Number = n())\ndf_type\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n# Groups:   Disorder group [3]\n   `Disorder group`    `Disorder type`                                    Number\n   <chr>               <chr>                                               <int>\n 1 Disorder            Biological anomaly                                     41\n 2 Disorder            Clinical syndrome                                     661\n 3 Disorder            Disease                                             57920\n 4 Disorder            Malformation syndrome                               37634\n 5 Disorder            Morphological anomaly                                2644\n 6 Disorder            Particular clinical situation in a disease or syn…    418\n 7 Group of disorders  Category                                              479\n 8 Group of disorders  Clinical group                                        952\n 9 Subtype of disorder Clinical subtype                                     7394\n10 Subtype of disorder Etiological subtype                                  4060\n11 Subtype of disorder Histopathological subtype                              40\n\n\nAfter a quick view on the column of “Disorder group”, it mainly provided different disorder types a group label for each, which to a certain extent, was not necessary at this early stage. So this column was removed for now from the contingency table, in order to focus solely on, “Disorder type” with the number of counts (or times it appeared in the dataset).\n\ndf_type <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(Number = n())\ndf_type\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n   `Disorder type`                                        Number\n   <chr>                                                   <int>\n 1 Biological anomaly                                         41\n 2 Category                                                  479\n 3 Clinical group                                            952\n 4 Clinical subtype                                         7394\n 5 Clinical syndrome                                         661\n 6 Disease                                                 57920\n 7 Etiological subtype                                      4060\n 8 Histopathological subtype                                  40\n 9 Malformation syndrome                                   37634\n10 Morphological anomaly                                    2644\n11 Particular clinical situation in a disease or syndrome    418\n\n\nThen to visualise this in a graphic way, a lollypop chart was built horizontally, with different types of rare disorders on the y-axis and the number of each type on the x-axis.\n\nggplot(data = df_type, aes(x = `Disorder type`, y = `Number`)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = `Disorder type`, xend = `Disorder type`, y = 0, yend = `Number`), colour = \"dark blue\") +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dark green\", size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  theme_light() +\n  coord_flip() \n\n\n\n\nTwo disorder types stood out the most, with “Disease” type appeared 57,920 times and “Malformation syndrome” at 37,634 times. To understand further what each of these two disorder types were, a direct reference3 was used. According to the source of the dataset:\nThe definition of “Disease” in the rare disorder context was “a disorder with homogeneous therapeutic possibilities and an identified physiopathological mechanism…”, one thing also worth noting was that this type did not include any developmental anomalies.\nFor “Malformation syndrome”, this was defined as, “A disorder resulting from a developmental anomaly involving more than one morphogenetic field. Malformative sequences and associations are included.”\nTo demonstrate this in a tabular form, with corresponding proportions of each disorder type in the dataset, the following codes were used:\n\ndf1 <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(n = n()) %>% \n  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n   `Disorder type`                                            n     prop\n   <chr>                                                  <int>    <dbl>\n 1 Biological anomaly                                        41 0.000365\n 2 Category                                                 479 0.00427 \n 3 Clinical group                                           952 0.00848 \n 4 Clinical subtype                                        7394 0.0659  \n 5 Clinical syndrome                                        661 0.00589 \n 6 Disease                                                57920 0.516   \n 7 Etiological subtype                                     4060 0.0362  \n 8 Histopathological subtype                                 40 0.000356\n 9 Malformation syndrome                                  37634 0.335   \n10 Morphological anomaly                                   2644 0.0236  \n11 Particular clinical situation in a disease or syndrome   418 0.00372 \n\n\nThe table was then rearranged with proportions in descending order (from highest to lowest). It also showed the top two were “Disease” (51.6%) and “Malformation syndrome” (33.5%).\n\ndf1 %>% arrange(desc(prop))\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n   `Disorder type`                                            n     prop\n   <chr>                                                  <int>    <dbl>\n 1 Disease                                                57920 0.516   \n 2 Malformation syndrome                                  37634 0.335   \n 3 Clinical subtype                                        7394 0.0659  \n 4 Etiological subtype                                     4060 0.0362  \n 5 Morphological anomaly                                   2644 0.0236  \n 6 Clinical group                                           952 0.00848 \n 7 Clinical syndrome                                        661 0.00589 \n 8 Category                                                 479 0.00427 \n 9 Particular clinical situation in a disease or syndrome   418 0.00372 \n10 Biological anomaly                                        41 0.000365\n11 Histopathological subtype                                 40 0.000356\n\n\n\nDistributions of HPO frequency\nThis was followed by checking out the distributions of HPO frequency to see which categories had the most and least number of counts.\n\ndf_freq <- df %>% \n  count(`HPO frequency`) %>% \n  arrange(desc(n))\ndf_freq\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  `HPO frequency`            n\n  <chr>                  <int>\n1 Occasional (29-5%)     41140\n2 Frequent (79-30%)      37480\n3 Very frequent (99-80%) 25892\n4 Very rare (<4-1%)       6414\n5 Excluded (0%)            705\n6 Obligate (100%)          610\n7 <NA>                       2\n\n\nResults for rare disorders with obligate or 100% frequency in patient’s populations were then filtered, showing disorder type, HPO frequency and disorder name. Specifically, I wanted to find out the disorder names associated with the “Disease” disorder type with HPO frequency of “Obligate (100%)”.\n\ndf_freq_ob <- df %>% \n  filter(`Disorder type` == \"Disease\", `HPO frequency` == \"Obligate (100%)\") %>% \n  select(`Disorder type`, `HPO frequency`, `Disorder name`)\ndf_freq_ob\n\n# A tibble: 404 × 3\n   `Disorder type` `HPO frequency` `Disorder name`                              \n   <chr>           <chr>           <chr>                                        \n 1 Disease         Obligate (100%) Retinoblastoma                               \n 2 Disease         Obligate (100%) Parathyroid carcinoma                        \n 3 Disease         Obligate (100%) Pituitary carcinoma                          \n 4 Disease         Obligate (100%) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia         \n 5 Disease         Obligate (100%) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia         \n 6 Disease         Obligate (100%) Ravine syndrome                              \n 7 Disease         Obligate (100%) Ravine syndrome                              \n 8 Disease         Obligate (100%) Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with a…\n 9 Disease         Obligate (100%) Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with a…\n10 Disease         Obligate (100%) PLIN1-related familial partial lipodystrophy \n# … with 394 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nI’d then like to look into associated counts of appearance of each disorder name.

using similar filtering method, we could quickly narrow down any particular rare disease of interest to find out specific phenotype or clinical features, along with associated HPO phenotype frequency,

one more piece of work towards this exploratory data analysis, I thought to check out the Validation date column. “Validation date” in this context meant the dates when the annotations of HPO terms were made for each rare disorder, which were based on the source articles listed (as shown in the Source column).\nFirstly, I started with the “Disease” disorder type and singled out the year component from the Validation date column.\n\ndf_val_date <- df %>% \n  mutate(year = year(`Validation date`), label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)\ndf_val_date\n\n# A tibble: 112,243 × 16\n   Disorder gr…¹

more rows, 7 more variables: Online <chr>, Source <chr>,\n#   `Validation date` <dttm>, `Validation status` <chr>, year <dbl>,\n#   label <lgl>, abbr <lgl>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​`Disorder group`,\n#   ²​`Disorder type`, ³​`HPO disorder & clinical entity association count`,\n#   ⁴​`Diagnostic criteria`, ⁵​`HPO frequency`, ⁶​`HPO ID`, ⁷​`Preferred HPO term`,\n#   ⁸​`Disorder name`, ⁹​`Disorder Orphacode`\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows, and `colnames()` to see all variable names\n\n\nTo show this in a dataframe, observations for “Disease” disorder type were shown by using a filter:\n\ndf_val_date_d <- df_val_date %>% \n  select(`Disorder type`, year) %>% \n  filter(`Disorder type` == \"Disease\")\ndf_val_date_d\n\n# A tibble: 57,920 × 2\n   `Disorder type`  year\n   <chr>           <dbl>\n 1 Disease          2016\n 2 Disease          2016\n 3 Disease          2016\n 4 Disease          2016\n 5 Disease          2016\n 6 Disease          2016\n 7 Disease          2016\n 8 Disease          2016\n 9 Disease          2016\n10 Disease          2016\n# … with 57,910 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nThen to make it easier to visualise, the year counts were plotted in a bar graph. Interestingly, 2016 seemed to be the year for rare disorders to be annotated with the most phenotypic features (if referring back to the original dataset, each observation or row was present for a unique “Preferred HPO term” or phenotypic abnormality).\n\ndf_val_date_d %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\nWarning: Removed 49 rows containing non-finite values (stat_count).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also worth noting that there were 49 rows of non-finite values excluded from the bar graph above. To look into this, a count on the year column of the dataframe df_val_date_d was done, which confirmed that these were the “NA” or missing values in the validation date column.\n\ndf_val_date_d %>% \n  count(year)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n   year     n\n  <dbl> <int>\n1  2015   567\n2  2016 14193\n3  2017  5419\n4  2018  6297\n5  2019 10525\n6  2020  9402\n7  2021 11468\n8    NA    49\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nTo quickly summarise key findings from this work4 regarding phenotypes associated with rare diseases:\n\nAutosomal recessive complex spastic paraplegia due to Kennedy pathway dysfunction was one of the most common rare diseases under the Disease disorder type with the most phenotypic abnormalities recorded, which were:\n\n\nprogressive spastic paraplegia\nmicrocephaly\nmoderately short stature\nnasal, dysarthic speech\ndelayed gross motor development\nprogressive spasticity\nlower limb hyperreflexia\nankle clonus\nretinal pigment epithelial mottling\nprogressive spastic paraparesis\n\n\nFor malformation syndrome of the rare disorder type, Hydrocephalus-obesity-hypogonadism syndrome was found to be one of the most common rare diseases with the most phenotypic abnormalities recorded, which were:\n\n\nhydrocephalus\nshort neck\ngynecomastia\nhypergonadotropic hypogonadism\nintellectual disability, mild\nobesity\nmitral valve prolapse\nlow posterior hairline\nhigh, narrow palate\ncubitus valgus\nshort stature\nshort 4th metacarpal\n\n\nThe year of 2016 had the highest number of HPO terms or phenotypic abnormalities annotated to rare disorders from specific named source articles, and on the contrary, 2015 had the lowest counts from the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nUsed only for initial data cleaning stage - please see this GitHub link for details. R was used for the rest of the analysis↩︎\nThis work is under CC BY-SA 4.0 International License if anyone is interested in exploring the dataset further↩︎\n“Orphadata: Free access products description” - April 2020. http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/img/PDF/OrphadataFreeAccessProductsDescription.pdf. Version 2↩︎\nIt’s possible to dig further into the dataset e.g. diagnostic criterion and perhaps even bring back some of the columns removed initially, however due to time constraints (due to being a one-person team and also I’d like to start on the COVID-19 antiviral work soon), I’ll leave some room here for the interested to work on the data↩︎"

    "text": "I was initially trained as a pharmacist in New Zealand, and spent several years working in community and hospital pharmacies. Somehow life took me on a detour where I went down the path of doing postgraduate studies. The research mainly focussed on drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry involved, with numerous hours spent in chemistry (wet) and computer (dry) labs doing experiments. The research work happened in Australia, where I’ve also continued to work as a hospital pharmacist while working on the research projects. Reflecting back, it felt like my brain cells have gone through a major metamorphasis during those years, before I ended up with a MPhil and PhD.\nI’ve then decided to return to New Zealand and the pandemic hit within a few months after, which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change. Subsequently, I discovered my more recent interests in the world of data science and analytics. This then led to this blog, which is really my portfolio, on data analytics work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical fields, as I came from these backgrounds with boundless interests. It’ll also be another channel for me to write personal blog posts detailing my journey in data analytics."
