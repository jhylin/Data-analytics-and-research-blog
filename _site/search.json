    "text": "Essentially, having completed this MPhil project1 was more like a warm-up before participating in a real research project at a grand scale. This was a new project at the time (between 2012 – 2014) as no one in my previous lab group was working on it so it was literally a one-person project but we were collaborating with a distant research group. Unfortunately this project came to an early stop during my PhD stage (when I was working part-time still as a pharmacist to support my own cost of living while receiving a puny amount of scholarship plus working on this project at the time and then one extra project added on during PhD). The main reason that this project did no progress was that our collaborators decided to pull out from testing further compounds for us. Although it came as a bit of shock but later it felt less so. Later, I’ve decided that it would still be part of my portfolio to showcase a project that did not proceed further (or in plain words, in the “failed” section).\nReflecting back to the whole experience for this project, I’ve learned my lessons about working with collaborators whose research focus was on entirely different but related field (their one was on molecular biology, while our side was on chemistry, I’ve been spending time working in both computer and chemistry labs, trying to identify likely compound candidate from molecular modelling and then synthesise the compounds in the lab for them to test). There should have been more communications if possible and perhaps we could’ve terminated the project earlier if needed so that we could allocate more time to work on other research project that better suited to the situation of our lab group. To have a closure for this project, I’ve written up a chapter about it in my PhD thesis to show what have been done and what other future work can be added if we have all the time and money in the world.\nLink to full MPhil thesis.\nAbstract of this project:\nThe goal of this research project was to discover potential chemical compounds that could be further developed to become lead compounds to target secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1) and also sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The drug design process would need to be robust enough to ask the question; could a SERCA inhibitor be developed based on the drug design process involving molecular modelling, chemical synthesis and biological testing? If this first step was achieved then the next critical step was to design a SPCA1 inhibitor as SPCA1 was found to be highly involved in basal-like breast cancer. The potential lead compounds would then have the opportunity to become novel anti-cancer agents targeting basal-like breast cancer in this context. The ultimate aim was to widen the current therapeutic agents available for patients with basal-like subtype of breast cancer in the hope to further improve their quality of life and life expectancy.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nthis was not a perfect example of drug discovery, I was a complete research newbie prior to this MPhil project and thinking back, I think I was far too ambitious…"

    "text": "I was initially trained as a pharmacist in New Zealand and my work then somehow sparked a detour for me to go into postgraduate studies, focussing on research in drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry involved (spent hours and hours in chemistry and computer labs for experiments). The research work happened in Australia, where I’ve also continued to work as a pharmacist while working on the research (thinking back, a lot of my brain cells have gone through a death and reborn process during those years, before I ended up with a MPhil and PhD).\nI’ve then decided to return to New Zealand and the pandemic hit, which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change as well. Then another detour followed, where I discovered my more recent interests in the world of data science and analytics. This then subsequently led to this blog, which is really my portfolio, on data analytics work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical fields, as I came from these backgrounds. It’ll also, at random times, be another channel for me to write personal blog posts detailing my journey in data analytics."

    "text": "SERCA project (details in a separate post as named)\nFilamenting temperature-sensitive Z protein project (also known as FtsZ project)\n\nFtsZ project was not a new project at the time, but rather a continuation from my previous predecessors in the lab group. Its primary focus was to look for other novel anti-bacterial hit compounds that were different from the ones that were already synthesised and tested in the group. This project was better than the SERCA project in a way that the collaborators were much easier to communicate with even though they were based in India. One down side was that because they’re based overseas, it did take a long time for the compound testing to happen and to have the results returned on time. However, overall, there were much more progress in this project which involved 3 main iterative stages:\nComputational work – involved molecular/homology modelling, virtual compound screening (compound size roughly in several 100,000s, please see below links for details) and compound selection for synthesis (using Schrödinger software mainly for this first stage of work)\nCompound synthesis – this was certainly the part that has painstakingly taken a lot of time in a chemistry lab out of my four years with many failures in between but with some successes in the end obviously…\nCompound testing – it was mainly done by our research collaborators After the completion of these two projects, I was less of a research newbie but I would still humbly call myself a junior researcher, considering how the field of drug discovery can have such an unfathomable depth and breadth…\n The image above was taken literally when I packed up everything after I’ve completed my PhD, which was physically summed into this little box, but what I’ve gained from the journey was far bigger than this. The two hardcover books on the left hand side were my MPhil and PhD theses (potentially useful as treatment for insomnia due to their lengths and time required to read).\nPlease see below for full details of my PhD work1 and abstract with link to my PhD thesis:\nLink to PhD thesis (beware: very long)\nAbstract for these two projects:\nDrug discovery is one of the most challenging research fields that contributes to the birth of novel drugs for therapeutic use. Due to the complexity and intricate nature of the research, lengthy processes are involved in identifying potential hit molecules for a therapeutic target. To shorten the time required to reach the hit-to-lead stage, computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been used to expedite the process and reduce laboratory expenses. Common strategies used within CADD involve structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD). Both strategies were used extensively in two projects showing the complementarity of each strategy throughout the process. In this work, two separate drug discovery projects are detailed: Design, synthesis and molecular docking study of novel tetrahydrocurcumin analogues as potential sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA) inhibitors – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit candidate(s) targeting SERCA by using SBDD Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) as therapeutic target in ligand-based drug design – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit molecule(s) targeting FtsZ In the first project, homology modelling and virtual compound library screening were utilised as the SBDD methods to identify potential hit molecules for testing in P-type calcium ATPases such as SERCA. Preliminary results have found compound 20, an analogue of tetrahydrocurcumin, to show some SERCA inhibitory effect at 300µM based on a SERCA-specific calcium signalling assay performed via fluorometric imaging plate reader. Molecular docking study has also reflected this outcome with desirable ligand-protein binding energies found for 20 when compared with other tested ligands. Pharmacophore screening was used as the main LBDD method in the second project to identify probable hit candidates targeting FtsZ. Potential ligands were synthesised, and tested for antibacterial effect in Bacillus Subtilis strain 168 (Bs168) and Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R6 (SpnR6) cells. One of the tetrahydrocurcumin analogues, compound 4, was found to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 10 µM in Bs168 cells and ≤ 2 µM in spnR6 cells. The IC50 values for 4 were 9.1 ± 0.01 µM and 1 ± 0.01 µM in Bs168 and SpnR6 cells respectively. The MIC of 4 was found to be very similar to the MIC of compound 1, a known hit compound targeting against Bs168 cells. On the other hand, the MIC of 4 was lower than the MIC (> 64 µg/mL) of a well-known FtsZ inhibitor, PC190723, against S. pneumoniae. Subsequent molecular docking analyses were completed to evaluate the ligand-protein binding energies to correlate against the testing results. Both compounds 20 and 4 possess some structural similarities and differences that may confer their different effects in these protein targets, which render both with potentials to become the next lead molecules for future development.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI have attempted to communicate with both of my PhD supervisors and also our research collaborators to publish this work, but to no avail due to the severe restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 situation from the beginning of 2020 till now, a direct publication in a scientific journal is not going to happen any time soon so I thought to provide at least my part from my PhD time to showcase what I’ve done at least… The more glorified version will hopefully be published one day in the future since more results would follow and make the story more complete. Updates from 31/1/2022 – it appeared that my supervisors are in communications with our overseas research collaborators recently about the manuscript so there is a higher chance now that we may be able to publish this work towards the end of 2022 (fingers-crossed…)↩︎"

Other factors that might have contributed to higher risk of suffering from long COVID were people who were above 60-65 years old and also people who have multiple chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
