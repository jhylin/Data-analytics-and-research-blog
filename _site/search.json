I’ve just completed and published the Python one (please see Portfolio section for details) and within this week I’m aiming to start the SQL project. This time I’ll not be using IBM Db2 or SQLite, which was what I’ve used for the course but rather I’ve managed to install MySQL server and also DBeaver GUI to work on the SQL project. The dataset is still to be decided as I sort of want to integrate the SQL one with Tableau and the latest Python project. I’ll have another look again…\n\n\n\nPhoto by Joanna Kosinska on Unsplash"

One other thing of note was that the paper only collected long COVID-related data up until 17th March 2021. All other more recent developments of long COVID will likely require more time before further data are more readily available, for example, the long COVID impact from Omicron variants.\n Image: Rawpixel.com\n\n\nThe process\nMySQL server was installed with DBeaver used as the GUI. Four tables (Continents, Countries, Risk factors and Hospitalisation) in .csv file formats were imported into the newly created database named LongCovid. A series of SQL queries were written and performed. Two views were created so that selected data were stored for future use, such as for data visualisations in Tableau.\n\n\nProject link\nSQL file can be found in my GitHub repository of Portfolio-projects at this URL: https://github.com/jhylin/Portfolio-projects or directly here to view.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe published date reflected the most recent date I worked on associated file with the project, prior to the blog move.

    "text": "The projects\nMy PhD12 started about 6 months after I’ve finished my MPhil so it was around the beginning of 2015 that I’ve officially begun my PhD and it took a solid 4 years to finish (while working part-time as a hospital pharmacist). In simple words, there were two main research projects going on concurrently in my PhD:\n\nSERCA project (details in a separate post as named)\nFilamenting temperature-sensitive Z protein project (also known as FtsZ project)\n\nFtsZ project was not a new project at the time, but rather a continuation from my previous predecessors in the lab group. Its primary focus was to look for other novel anti-bacterial hit compounds that were different from the ones that were already synthesised and tested in the group. This project was better than the SERCA project in a way that the collaborators were much easier to communicate with even though they were based in India. One down side was that because they’re based overseas, it did take a long time for the compound testing to happen and to have the results returned on time. However, overall, there were much more progress in this project which involved 3 main iterative stages:\nComputational work – involved molecular/homology modelling, virtual compound screening (compound size roughly in several 100,000s, please see below links for details) and compound selection for synthesis (using Schrödinger software mainly for this first stage of work)\nCompound synthesis – this was certainly the part that has painstakingly taken a lot of time in a chemistry lab out of my four years with many failures in between but with some successes in the end obviously…\nCompound testing – it was mainly done by our research collaborators After the completion of these two projects, I was less of a research newbie but I would still humbly call myself a junior researcher, considering how the field of drug discovery can have such an unfathomable depth and breadth…\n\n\n\nImage taken by author\n\n\nThe image above was taken literally when I packed up everything after I’ve completed my PhD, which was physically summed into this little box, but what I’ve gained from the journey was far bigger than this. The two hardcover books on the left hand side were my MPhil and PhD theses (potentially useful as treatment for insomnia due to their lengths and time required to read).\n\n\nPhD thesis link\nPlease visit http://hdl.handle.net/2123/20236 if anyone is even remotely wanting to read the full thesis, for completeness, here it is (beware: very long).\n\n\nAbstract of the projects\nDrug discovery is one of the most challenging research fields that contributes to the birth of novel drugs for therapeutic use. Due to the complexity and intricate nature of the research, lengthy processes are involved in identifying potential hit molecules for a therapeutic target. To shorten the time required to reach the hit-to-lead stage, computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been used to expedite the process and reduce laboratory expenses. Common strategies used within CADD involve structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD). Both strategies were used extensively in two projects showing the complementarity of each strategy throughout the process. In this work, two separate drug discovery projects are detailed: Design, synthesis and molecular docking study of novel tetrahydrocurcumin analogues as potential sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA) inhibitors – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit candidate(s) targeting SERCA by using SBDD Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) as therapeutic target in ligand-based drug design – details the identification, synthesis and testing of potential hit molecule(s) targeting FtsZ In the first project, homology modelling and virtual compound library screening were utilised as the SBDD methods to identify potential hit molecules for testing in P-type calcium ATPases such as SERCA. Preliminary results have found compound 20, an analogue of tetrahydrocurcumin, to show some SERCA inhibitory effect at 300µM based on a SERCA-specific calcium signalling assay performed via fluorometric imaging plate reader. Molecular docking study has also reflected this outcome with desirable ligand-protein binding energies found for 20 when compared with other tested ligands. Pharmacophore screening was used as the main LBDD method in the second project to identify probable hit candidates targeting FtsZ. Potential ligands were synthesised, and tested for antibacterial effect in Bacillus Subtilis strain 168 (Bs168) and Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R6 (SpnR6) cells. One of the tetrahydrocurcumin analogues, compound 4, was found to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 10 µM in Bs168 cells and ≤ 2 µM in spnR6 cells. The IC50 values for 4 were 9.1 ± 0.01 µM and 1 ± 0.01 µM in Bs168 and SpnR6 cells respectively. The MIC of 4 was found to be very similar to the MIC of compound 1, a known hit compound targeting against Bs168 cells. On the other hand, the MIC of 4 was lower than the MIC (> 64 µg/mL) of a well-known FtsZ inhibitor, PC190723, against S. pneumoniae. Subsequent molecular docking analyses were completed to evaluate the ligand-protein binding energies to correlate against the testing results. Both compounds 20 and 4 possess some structural similarities and differences that may confer their different effects in these protein targets, which render both with potentials to become the next lead molecules for future development.\n\n\nFinal update on FtsZ project\nAs time was ticking along towards the end of 2022, my last attempt to try to get this work published occurred around end of August, where I contacted one of my previous PhD advisers. After that I actually thought there was no way I could carry on in this line of research work, or even think about expanding into cheminformatics for drug discovery and design etc. So in September, I thought about leaving all of this behind and that I need to change direction completely (again), e.g. into health data science or similar. Perhaps it was the universe’s answering or for other unknown reasons, around end of September, an email was sent to me from my previous PhD adviser asking for my help to organise the draft manuscript into the journal template that we were intending to submit. Then in early October, I got another email saying our manuscript was submitted. Then it seemed things started to roll again, after 2019. So this was, indeed, a perfect example showing how a piece of research work was stalled, not only by the commonly known reasons such as delays from collaborating groups, but also by the global-scale pandemic and finally somehow, miraculously, made it to the publication stage.\nIf anyone asked me if I wanted to go through this again, I would firmly say no as it was mentally painful, but on the other hand, I’ve also gained invaluable things like grit and resilience throughout the process. This has, without doubts, influenced on how I want to approach similar research again, which will be in a different way, in a more data-informed way.\n\n\nPublished paper link\nThis will complete the story for the FtsZ project (finally): Discovery of 2′,6-Bis(4-hydroxybenzyl)-2-acetylcyclohexanone, a Novel FtsZ Inhibitor\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI’ve attempted to communicate with both of my PhD advisers and our research collaborators to publish this work, but to no avail due to the severe restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 situation from the beginning of 2020 and basically also in 2021 (our collaborators were unable to perform any experiments during lockdowns…), a direct publication in a scientific journal is not going to happen any time soon so I thought to provide at least my part to showcase what I’ve done at least…↩︎\nUpdates on 31/1/2022 – it appeared that my supervisors are in communications with our overseas research collaborators recently about the manuscript so there is a higher chance now that we may be able to publish this work towards the end of 2022 (fingers-crossed…).↩︎"

    "text": "Introduction\nThis project1 was entirely self-motivated and out of personal interests since COVID has widely and deeply affected many people nowadays. I was also learning Tableau while I worked on this project. This has also made me realised that I might have started from the harder end first by learning Python programming language first in 2019 and then picking up the rest of the data analytics tools towards late 2021. It was completely interesting and absolutely fascinating at how different softwares vary but with common themes in mind.\n Image: Rawpixel.com\n\n\nSource of dataset\nThe source of the dataset was from a relatively recent live systemic review paper: Michelen M, Manoharan L, Elkheir N, et al. Characterising long COVID: a living systematic review. BMJ Global Health 2021;6:e005427\n\n\nProject link\nThis project can be accessed at this link from Tableau Public.\n\n\nSummary\nThe data from this paper have shown a very heterogeneous variety of long COVID-related signs and symptoms. Among them, it appeared that female gender had higher risk of suffering from long COVID than the male populations. Other factors that might have contributed to higher risk of suffering from long COVID were people who were above 60-65 years old and also people who have multiple chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Since this paper only focussed on dataset up until March 2021, more recent variants of COVID would not be covered in the dataset, therefore, more work would be required to look into the long COVID risk inflicted by more recent COVID variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe published date reflected the last day I worked on the associated files for this project, prior to the blog move.

The previous log loss was 0.606602645025058, which meant there was only a very small margin of improvement of the model.\n\n# Log loss\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nlog_loss(y_test, y_mp_proba)\n\n0.608337653347155\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions and conclusion\nWithout any surprises, the re-trained model did not provide a huge difference from the initial one, which was already expected in ML series 2. However, the purpose of tuning the parameters to reach a more optimised model was still achieved in a very small way, where there was a less than 1% increase in accuracy score and an even smaller increase in log loss value for the re-trained model. The confusion matrix showed a small improvement, with 114 predictions that were false positive and false negatives in the original model and 113 predictions for the same categories in the current model. The classification report basically had very minute change, with only the recall value going up from 0.69 in the old model to 0.70 in the current model in class label zero. Overall, this was not significant enough, given the goal was to improve the model. However, as a learning exercise I think I’ve learnt something along the way, and hopefully I’ll use it to show a much more significant improvement in other future ML scenarios.\nOne of the other things I could try next, if I were to use the same set of dataset, was to change the features used to train the model. Max phase, number of rule-of-5 violations, QED weighted scores, CX LogP, CX LogD and the number of heavy atoms for small molecules used in ML series 1 to 3 might, in fact, not be the best set of features to be used at all. They were mainly randomly chosen, without much thoughts placed into it, however I tried to use QED weighted score as it incorporated several renowned physicochemical factors for small molcules in general, but on the other hand, I could not prove that QED weighted was not biased at all, so some considerations should also be given to this aspect, perhaps more features could be included or changed to see the effect on the model during model evaluation phase. I could also use other types of ML approaches to build the model, which might produce a better prediction model to predict the max phases of small molecules.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nCurrently, I haven’t thought too much about what my next project will be, as I’m trying to brush up my Python skills further to make sure I understand most of its concepts and usages by practising on LeetCode. There may be a bit of a break before I embark on my next idea. One thing for sure, I’ll try to up my experience in ML either with the same set of data in newer version of ChEMBL database (ChEMBL released a version 32 recently) or a different set of data using a different ML approach.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nscikit-learn documentation\nScikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011.\nBruce, P., Bruce, A. & Gedeck P.

So I did it finally…\n\n\n\nPhoto by visuals on Unsplash\n\n\nOne of the reasons that I’ve finally decided to post on Twitter is that I’ve heard about the active and friendly R community on Twitter and thought if I could get any feedbacks on my short piece of work in R then that’ll be helpful for me to see if I’ve missed or done anything incorrectly since there’s not really a mentor person around that is able to do this at the moment (I’ve dreadfully taken the self-learning route, rather than attending data science bootcamps or get “another” degree, which is something I’m not really fancied at doing again, after already having MPhil and PhD already…). Luckily, I did get one helpful response and with a small number of likes so perhaps I’m not doing it entirely wrong (hopefully). My future plans will likely be trying to do a #TidyTuesday data visualisation and post whenever I can to learn and grow.\nI’ve also recently edited my rare disease drug projects in R and Python to add summaries of findings from these two projects so it’s easier for anyone to read, especially if there’s not really much time to go through long threads of codes in GitHub. I’m also currently working on another project in the rare diseases series on phenotypes associated with rare diseases from Orphanet. My plan at the moment is to use Python to clean the data (I’ve tried to load it in RStudio via a URL with XML file, it’s >4000 rows and taking quite a long time to run on my laptop, so will stick to Python on Anaconda as it has loaded a lot faster than RStudio, then perhaps once it’s cleaned, I’ll re-import it back into RStudio for analysis and visualisations)."

    "title": "Shinylive app in Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Coding for Shinylive app in Python\nThe entire code for this Shiny app in Python were written in VS Code initially. When I was looking for places to deploy the app, I then migrated the code to RStudio IDE (note: recently I saw Python code in Quarto documents being used in VS Code after I’ve deployed this app, so this might be another option).\nFor data preparation stage, please visit this post for details.\n\n\nTrialling open-source large-language models\nThere have been a lot of hypes surrounding large-language models (LLMs) or generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). I’m still somewhat both reserved and excited about them at present. The area I’m most concerned with is where are the relevant laws, regulations and ethics on using these tools in public domains, whether for private or commercial uses, and will they be country-specific or globally streamlined? While I have these questions in mind, I’m not denying the fact that they can be useful for a few well-known purposes in coding, such as requesting for regex code templates for text cleaning or asking for code snippets while programmers are busy with several tasks at the same time.\nI thought to trial out the open-source LLMs a little bit when I was working on this app, since they were the open and transparent versions with potentials for personal or commercial uses. So I’ve tested about 3 different open-source LLMs, which were H2OGPT, HuggingChat and StableLM. I decided to only give minimal amount of prompts (I’ve given H2OGPT three prompts, and only one prompt each for either HuggingChat and StableLM), and the question was framed around providing a code outline for building a Shiny app using Python and Polars dataframe libary, and see what answers they could each provide.\nAll of them produced answers that were close to what I’ve asked for, i.e. I could see a code outline for a Shiny app.py file at first but it was more like R code, with one case mixing both Python and R in the code concurrently. However, none of them actually reached exactly how I’ve asked them to provide, perhaps if I’ve given more prompts then they might manage to provide answers closer to the request. Also, none of them were able to pick up the more recent Polars dataframe library (which were probably more prominent from 2021 onwards) and also Shiny in Python (which was also quite new as well, only out of alpha phase recently). All of them only showed code using Pandas dataframe libray, even though I did mention Polars in all of the question prompts. Once I get to use more of these open-source LLMs in the future, which currently are gaining more traction from what I’ve read online, I think I might try to write another post about them later.\n\n\n\nUsing Shiny in Python documentations\nAfter trialling open-source LLMs a bit to help with the coding part (although not as helpful as I first imagined, but they still somewhat provided a rough code framework for Shiny apps), I completed the app.py script in the end by using mainly documents from Shiny for Python website. I still think thorough documentations for any products are still fundamental and inevitable, because these documentations will be sources to provide high-quality data for training these LLMs which means they’ll be of higher quality too.\nSeveral links I’ve used and found to be very informative:\n\n“Shiny for Python out of alpha” - quick summary on recent status update and new features such as shinyswatch and shinywidgets on Shiny for Python\n“Quickstart for R users” - a very useful link for people who are R users or already familiar with Shiny apps in R, and would like to build Shiny apps in Python\n“Shinylive: Shiny + WebAssembly” - great for understanding Shinylive\n“Shinylive applications embedded in Quarto documents” - this is all about embedding shinylive app in Quarto - the webpage link provided here is from this GitHub repository on Quarto extension for shinylive\n\n\n\n\n\nApp deployment\nAfter building the app in a workable condition, I started looking at where and how to deploy this Shiny app written in Python. Initially I used the easiest method as stated from the Shinylive link above, which was to deploy on Shinylive editor. One drawback for this was that the application URL was extremely long as the URL hash would store the entire app code inside. However, this was indeed one of the simplest ways to share the apps with others quickly, by simply providing the URL link with the intended audience.\nI then went on to try another method where I spent one afternoon trying to figure out that I had to add an install_certificate.command for my operating system since I installed Python by using Homebrew in the first place (which some clever users might already know to avoid…), so that I could resolve the SSL certificate issue if I’m trying to connect with Shinyapps.io.\nI also tried to follow another method from an earlier time which suggested to deploy the app directly on GitHub Pages, but since then the code was changed and updated to a different version and the old method no longer worked as nicely as mentioned (a lot of the code for Shiny in Python can still be experimental, and can change drastically, so check the sources to see the latest updates). I then stumbled upon another GitHub repository from the Quarto team at Posit/RStudio and looked into the possibility and tested it. Eventually, I settled on this method - embedding the app in a Quarto document, which provided both code and app itself on this very same webpage down below.\nOne of the downsides of the following code that I couldn’t quite get rid of yet was the poor file importation style for loading a .csv file locally. I’ve added code annotations as comments to explain what I’ve done. The solution to import .csv file into app.py for the embedding version was from this discussion in the repository (thanks to that particular user who found this hacky way to do it). However, the plus side was that coding for the rest of the app was not bad at all and worked seamlessly. I’ll try to follow up later on whether importing .csv file for app embedding could be easier, perhaps this might be something the Quarto team is working right now.\nThe second downside was that shinyswatch package might not be functional yet for this embedding method (but most likely would work if deploying apps to shinyapps.io). This meant there would be no background visual themes yet for apps embedded in Quarto docs, but hopefully this would be possible in the future. Overall, I was amazed at how easy it was to build, deploy and embed a Shiny app in Python in a Quarto document.\nNote: if using Shinylive editor, make sure to include a requirement.txt file if using extra Python packages such as Pandas or Plotly. For embedding apps in Quarto docs, this appears not to be compulsory and only optional when I tried it down below.\nCode for this post (.qmd document) is available here.\n\n\nShinylive app in

    "text": "Brief introduction\nSince I’ve had a lot of fun building a Shiny app in R last time, I was on track to build another Shiny app again but using Python instead. So here in this post, I’ll talk about the data wrangling process to prepare the final dataset needed to build a Shinylive app in Python. The actual Shinylive app deployment and access will be shown in a separate post after this one.\n\n\n\nSource of data\nThe dataset used for this Shiny app in Python was from PubChem (link here). There were a total of 631 compounds at the time when I downloaded them as .csv file, along with their relevant compound data. I only picked this dataset randomly, as the focus would be more on app building, but it was nice to see an interactive web app being built and used for a domain such as pharmaceutical research.\n\n\n\nImport Polars\nPolars dataframe library was used again this time.\n\nimport polars as pl\n\n\n\n\nReading .csv file\n\npc = pl.read_csv(\"pubchem.csv\")\npc.head()\n\n\n\n\nshape: (5,

dataset\nThe definitions for some of the column names were shown below, which were mainly derived and adapted from PubChem:\nNote: please refer to PubChem documentations for full definitions\n\nMolecular weight - molecular mass of compounds measured in daltons\nTopological polar surface area - measured as an estimate of polar surface area of a molecule (i.e. the surface sum over polar atoms in a molecule), with units in angstrom squared (Å2)\nComplexity - complexity rating for compounds, based on Bertz/Hendrickson/Ihlenfeldt formula as a rough estimation of how complex a compound was structurally\nPartition coefficients (xlogp) - predicted octanol-water partition coefficient as a measure of the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a molecule\nHeavy atom count - number of heavy atoms e.g. non-hydrogen atoms in the compound\nHydrogen bond donor count - number of hydrogen bond donors in the compound\nHydrogen bond acceptor count - number of hydrogen bond acceptors in the compound\nRotatable bond count - defined as any single-order non-ring bond, where atoms on either side of the bond were in turn bound to non-terminal heavy atoms (e.g. non-hydrogen). Rotation around the bond axis would change overall molecule shape and generate conformers which could be distinguished by standard spectroscopic methods\nExact mass - exact mass of an isotopic species, obtained by summing masses of individual isotopes of the molecule\nMonoisotopic mass - sum of the masses of atoms in a molecule, using unbound, ground-state, rest mass of principal (or most abundant) isotope for each element instead of isotopic average mass\nFormal charge - the difference between the number of valence electrons of each atom, and the number of electrons the atom was associated with, assumed any shared electrons were equally shared between the two bonded atoms\nCovalently-bonded unit count - a group of atoms connected by covalent bonds, ignoring other bond types (or a single atom without covalent bonds), representing number of such units in the compound\nIsotope atom count - number of isotopes that were not most abundant for the corresponding chemical elements. Isotopes were variants of a chemical element that differed in neutron number\nDefined atom stereocenter count - atom stereocenter (or chiral center) was where an atom was attached to 4 different types of atoms or groups of atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. It could either be (R)- or (S)- configurations. Some of the compounds e.g. racemic mixtures, could have undefined atom stereocenter, where (R/S)-config was not specifically defined.

assignments in Polars\nThe longer I’ve used Polars, the more I like its coding styles of chaining a string of different code functions together to manipulate dataframes in one go. This usually might mean that we could avoid writing some repeated loop functions to achieve the same results. In the example below, I’d like to show how to chain “when-then-otherwise” expressions by using Polars.\n\n\nChaining when-then-otherwise expressions - creating groups in data\nI had the idea of separating all data into 3 different ranges of partition coefficients, so that this could be shown visually in plots. One of the possible ways (other than writing a loop function), or really the long way, to do this might be like the code shown below:\n```{python}\npart_coef_1 = pc_cov.filter(pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") <= -10)\npart_coef_2 = pc_cov.filter((pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") >= -11) & (pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") <= 5))\npart_coef_3 = pc_cov.filter(pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") >= 6)\n```\nA shorter and probably more elegant way was to use the “when-then-otherwise” expression in Polars for conditional assignments (the following code snippet was adapted with thanks to the author of Polars, Ritchie Vink and also the good old Stack Overflow):\n\npc_cov = pc_cov.with_column(\n    pl.when((pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") <= -10))\n    .then(\"Smaller than -10\")\n    .when((pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") >= -11) & (pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") <= 5))\n    .then(\"Between -11 and 5\")\n    .otherwise(\"Larger than 6\")\n    .alias(\"Part_coef_group\")\n)\n\npc_cov.head(10)\n\n# a new column would be added to the end of the dataframe \n# with a new column name, \"Part_coef_group\" \n# (scroll to the very right to see the added column)\n\n\n\n\nshape: (10, 21)\n\n\n\n\nCompound name\n\n\nMolecular weight\n\n\nPolar surface area\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\nPartition coefficients\n\n\nHeavy atom count\n\n\nHydrogen bond donor count\n\n\nHydrogen bond acceptor count\n\n\nRotatable bond count\n\n\nExact mass\n\n\nMonoisotopic mass\n\n\nFormal charge\n\n\nCovalently-bonded unit count\n\n\nIsotope atom count\n\n\nTotal atom stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined atom stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined atoms stereocenter count\n\n\nTotal bond stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\nPart_coef_group\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Calcitriol\"\n\n\n416.6\n\n\n60.7\n\n\n688.0\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n30\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Ubiquinol\"\n\n\n865.4\n\n\n58.9\n\n\n1600.0\n\n\n20.2\n\n\n63\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n31\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Glutamine\"\n\n\n146.14\n\n\n106.0\n\n\n146.0\n\n\n-3.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Aspirin\"\n\n\n180.16\n\n\n63.6\n\n\n212.0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n13\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"1-Methylnicoti...\n\n\n137.16\n\n\n47.0\n\n\n136.0\n\n\n-0.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Losartan\"\n\n\n422.9\n\n\n92.5\n\n\n520.0\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n30\n\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n8\n\n\n422.162\n\n\n422.162\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Vitamin E\"\n\n\n430.7\n\n\n29.5\n\n\n503.0\n\n\n10.7\n\n\n31\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n12\n\n\n430.381\n\n\n430.381\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Nicotinamide\"\n\n\n122.12\n\n\n56.0\n\n\n114.0\n\n\n-0.4\n\n\n9\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n122.048\n\n\n122.048\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Adenosine\"\n\n\n267.24\n\n\n140.0\n\n\n335.0\n\n\n-1.1\n\n\n19\n\n\n4\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n267.097\n\n\n267.097\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Inosine\"\n\n\n268.23\n\n\n129.0\n\n\n405.0\n\n\n-1.3\n\n\n19\n\n\n4\n\n\n7\n\n\n2\n\n\n268.081\n\n\n268.081\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Plotly\nTime for some data vizzes -

It contained 37 columns with 112,243 rows originally, which took quite a long time to load on RStudio (or could be due to my laptop capacity…). It loaded relatively faster on Jupyter notebook from Anaconda, so I then decided to clean it up first using Python1 there. Some columns were removed which reduced the total number of columns from 37 to 13, while not changing any of the rows at all. The columns were also renamed to make it easier to read.\n\n\nSource of dataset\nOrphadata: Free access data from Orphanet. © INSERM 1999. Available on http://www.orphadata.org.

So, here’s the question: what are the most common rare disorders and their associated phenotypic features?\nTo answer it, let’s observe the spread of the disorder groups and types first by formulating a contingency table.\n\ndf_type <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder group`,`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(Number = n())\ndf_type\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n# Groups:   Disorder group [3]\n   `Disorder group`    `Disorder type`                                    Number\n   <chr>               <chr>                                               <int>\n 1 Disorder            Biological anomaly                                     41\n 2 Disorder            Clinical syndrome                                     661\n 3 Disorder            Disease                                             57920\n 4 Disorder            Malformation syndrome                               37634\n 5 Disorder            Morphological anomaly                                2644\n 6 Disorder            Particular clinical situation in a disease or syn…    418\n 7 Group of disorders  Category                                              479\n 8 Group of disorders  Clinical group                                        952\n 9 Subtype of disorder Clinical subtype                                     7394\n10 Subtype of disorder Etiological subtype                                  4060\n11 Subtype of disorder Histopathological subtype                              40\n\n\nAfter a quick view on the column of “Disorder group”, it mainly provided different disorder types a group label for each, which to a certain extent, was not necessary at this early stage. So this column was removed for now from the contingency table, in order to focus solely on, “Disorder type” with the number of counts (or times it appeared in the dataset).\n\ndf_type <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(Number = n())\ndf_type\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n   `Disorder type`                                        Number\n   <chr>                                                   <int>\n 1 Biological anomaly                                         41\n 2 Category                                                  479\n 3 Clinical group                                            952\n 4 Clinical subtype                                         7394\n 5 Clinical syndrome                                         661\n 6 Disease                                                 57920\n 7 Etiological subtype                                      4060\n 8 Histopathological subtype                                  40\n 9 Malformation syndrome                                   37634\n10 Morphological anomaly                                    2644\n11 Particular clinical situation in a disease or syndrome    418\n\n\nThen to visualise this in a graphic way, a lollypop chart was built horizontally, with different types of rare disorders on the y-axis and the number of each type on the x-axis.\n\nggplot(data = df_type, aes(x = `Disorder type`, y = `Number`)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = `Disorder type`, xend = `Disorder type`, y = 0, yend = `Number`), colour = \"dark blue\") +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dark green\", size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  theme_light() +\n  coord_flip() \n\n\n\n\nTwo disorder types stood out the most, with “Disease” type appeared 57,920 times and “Malformation syndrome” at 37,634 times. To understand further what each of these two disorder types were, a direct reference3 was used. According to the source of the dataset:\nThe definition of “Disease” in the rare disorder context was “a disorder with homogeneous therapeutic possibilities and an identified physiopathological mechanism…”, one thing also worth noting was that this type did not include any developmental anomalies.\nFor “Malformation syndrome”, this was defined as, “A disorder resulting from a developmental anomaly involving more than one morphogenetic field. Malformative sequences and associations are included.”\nTo demonstrate this in a tabular form, with corresponding proportions of each disorder type in the dataset, the following code were used:\n\ndf1 <- df %>% \n  group_by(`Disorder type`) %>% \n  summarise(n = n()) %>% \n  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n   `Disorder type`                                            n     prop\n   <chr>                                                  <int>    <dbl>\n 1 Biological anomaly                                        41 0.000365\n 2 Category                                                 479 0.00427 \n 3 Clinical group                                           952 0.00848 \n 4 Clinical subtype                                        7394 0.0659  \n 5 Clinical syndrome                                        661 0.00589 \n 6 Disease                                                57920 0.516   \n 7 Etiological subtype                                     4060 0.0362  \n 8 Histopathological subtype                                 40 0.000356\n 9 Malformation syndrome                                  37634 0.335   \n10 Morphological anomaly                                   2644 0.0236  \n11 Particular clinical situation in a disease or syndrome   418 0.00372 \n\n\nThe table was then rearranged with proportions in descending order (from highest to lowest).

Interestingly, 2016 seemed to be the year for rare disorders to be annotated with the most phenotypic features (if referring back to the original dataset, each observation or row was present for a unique “Preferred HPO term” or phenotypic abnormality).\n\ndf_val_date_d %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\nWarning: Removed 49 rows containing non-finite values (stat_count).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also worth noting that there were 49 rows of non-finite values excluded from the bar graph above. To look into this, a count on the year column of the dataframe df_val_date_d was done, which confirmed that these were the “NA” or missing values in the validation date column.\n\ndf_val_date_d %>% \n  count(year)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n   year     n\n  <dbl> <int>\n1  2015   567\n2  2016 14193\n3  2017  5419\n4  2018  6297\n5  2019 10525\n6  2020  9402\n7  2021 11468\n8    NA    49\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nTo quickly summarise key findings from this work4 regarding phenotypes associated with rare diseases:\n\nAutosomal recessive complex spastic paraplegia due to Kennedy pathway dysfunction was one of the most common rare diseases under the Disease disorder type with the most phenotypic abnormalities recorded, which were:\n\n\nprogressive spastic paraplegia\nmicrocephaly\nmoderately short stature\nnasal, dysarthic speech\ndelayed gross motor development\nprogressive spasticity\nlower limb hyperreflexia\nankle clonus\nretinal pigment epithelial mottling\nprogressive spastic paraparesis\n\n\nFor malformation syndrome of the rare disorder type, Hydrocephalus-obesity-hypogonadism syndrome was found to be one of the most common rare diseases with the most phenotypic abnormalities recorded, which were:\n\n\nhydrocephalus\nshort neck\ngynecomastia\nhypergonadotropic hypogonadism\nintellectual disability, mild\nobesity\nmitral valve prolapse\nlow posterior hairline\nhigh, narrow palate\ncubitus valgus\nshort stature\nshort 4th metacarpal\n\n\nThe year of 2016 had the highest number of HPO terms or phenotypic abnormalities annotated to rare disorders from specific named source articles, and on the contrary, 2015 had the lowest counts from the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nUsed only for initial data cleaning stage - please see this GitHub link for details.

    "text": "Essentially, having completed this MPhil project1 was more like a warm-up before participating in a real research project at a grand scale. This was a new project at the time (between 2012 – 2014) as no one in my previous lab group was working on it so it was literally a one-person project but we were collaborating with a distant research group. Unfortunately this project came to an early stop during my PhD stage (when I was working part-time still as a pharmacist to support my own cost of living while receiving a puny amount of scholarship plus working on this project at the time and then one extra project added on during PhD). The main reason that this project did no progress was that our collaborators decided to pull out from testing further compounds for us. Although it came as a bit of shock but later it felt less so. Later, I’ve decided that it would still be part of my portfolio to showcase a project that did not proceed further (or in plain words, in the “failed” section).\nReflecting back to the whole experience for this project, I’ve learned my lessons about working with collaborators whose research focus was on entirely different but related field (their one was on molecular biology, while our side was on chemistry, I’ve been spending time working in both computer and chemistry labs, trying to identify likely compound candidate from molecular modelling and then synthesise the compounds in the lab for them to test). There should have been more communications if possible and perhaps we could’ve terminated the project earlier if needed so that we could allocate more time to work on other research project that better suited to the situation of our lab group. To have a closure for this project, I’ve written up a chapter about it in my PhD thesis to show what have been done and what other future work can be added if we have all the time and money in the world.\n Image: Rawpixel.com\nLink to MPhil thesis (beware: quite long)\nAbstract of this project:\nThe goal of this research project was to discover potential chemical compounds that could be further developed to become lead compounds to target secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1) and also sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The drug design process would need to be robust enough to ask the question; could a SERCA inhibitor be developed based on the drug design process involving molecular modelling, chemical synthesis and biological testing? If this first step was achieved then the next critical step was to design a SPCA1 inhibitor as SPCA1 was found to be highly involved in basal-like breast cancer. The potential lead compounds would then have the opportunity to become novel anti-cancer agents targeting basal-like breast cancer in this context. The ultimate aim was to widen the current therapeutic agents available for patients with basal-like subtype of breast cancer in the hope to further improve their quality of life and life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nthis was not a perfect example of drug discovery, I was a complete research newbie prior to this MPhil project and thinking back, I think I was far too ambitious…↩︎"

    "text": "Introduction\nSince it is common knowledge that it takes a very long time to discover and develop novel therpapeutic drugs. I’ve also often wondered about drugs for rare diseases and how they’re often for the minorities in the diseased populations. So here is the initial Python and R projects1 about rare disease drugs by using data extracted from FDA’s Orphan Drug Product designation database. I also have to acknowledge “Data Is Plural” website, which has inspired me to look into this dataset.\nUnfortunately this particular dataset I’ve obtained does not contain information on incentives for pharmaceutical companies (from US’s Orphan Drug Act of 1983), which could mean that I might be able to draw some preliminary, basic or raw correlations between incentives and rare disease drug marketing approvals (this might lead to other controversial discussions about this area, which was not my initial aim for this project as I just wanted to explore a dataset on rare disease drugs at the moment).\nThe datatset was for the period from 1983 till present, for approved rare disease drugs only.\n\n\nPython project\nFor Python project2, there was one question in mind to answer:\nHow long did it take on average for a rare disease drug to reach marketing approval?\nPython version of the data analysis: link\nShort summary of findings from this dataset using Python:\n\nThe orphan designation for rare disease drug that had the highest counts between 1983 till present was for the treatment of multiple myeloma\nThe highest counts of final approved indication for rare disease drugs spanned across several different clinical indications – it often ended up with more indication details than the initial orphan designation phase\nThe average time required for a rare disease drug to progress from the initial designation phase to the final approval for marketing was about 1932 days (~5 years)\nThe horizontal bar graph (access from link above) showed the top ten rare disease drugs with the longest time taken to reach the market Tiopronin was the one that took the longest time of 12,215 days (~33 years)\nThe data for Tiopronin appeared to be duplicates, but note that the two were formulated differently as one of them was the enteric-coated (EC) version (marketed as delayed-release tablets under the actual trade name of “Thiola EC”, but recorded in the dataset as “Thiola” only), while the other one was the immediate-release form (Thiola)\n\n Image: Rawpixel.com\n\n\nR project\nFor R project3, there were two questions in mind to answer:\n\nWhat countries were involved in rare disease drug developments?\nHow would the time from designation to approval be displayed in timeline style for selected rare disease drugs?\n\nR versions of the data analysis:\n\nbase R methods via Jupyter notebook with link\nTidyverse version via RStudio with link - done using RMarkdown\n\nShort summary of findings from this dataset using R:\n\nUS was the country that had the most involvement in rare disease drug developments, which was followed by Ireland and the UK, and also a number of other countries\nMore work could possibly go into looking at the duplicates of brand names of the same generic drug e.g. cannabidiol with trade name as Epidiolex that had 5 repeated timelines (shown in link above), which appeared to be different clinical indications for each of these entries after further checks\nThe timelines have also implied that drug discovery and development is a very timely process, which could span many years, such as 10 – 20 years or more, before a drug actually reaches the market for public use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis work is under CC BY-SA 4.0 International License for anyone interested in exploring the topic further.↩︎\nThe published date of this project would be based on the last day I’ve worked on associated file, prior to the blog move↩︎\nThe R versions, base R and Tidyverse projects, were done after the Python one was completed↩︎"

    "text": "After my PhD study came to an end at around the end of 2018 to early 2019, I’ve decided to return to New Zealand. This was followed by my tumultuous postdoc searching story and also a solitude time for myself to dig deeper into what I would really like to do research-wise. This, of course, then led to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which in a sense has been world-changing (I don’t know what other words or terms can better describe it) and its after-effect is still hanging around until this very moment…\nRegarding to the postdoc job searching, this has made me ponder really hard about what sort of research I would really like to work on. As I’ve spent time preparing my CV, writing different cover letters, applying for different postdoc-related roles and also after being invited to five job interviews, I’ve decided that it was not quite enough about what I’ve done so far in Masters and PhD work… I’m still lacking some skills. I’ve also realised that I do not necessarily like the traditional academic postdoc work (discovered while and after I’ve applied for numerous postdoc posts in 2019) and also I’m more inclined to work on computational chemistry and cheminformatics side of research.\nAnother “elephant-in-the-room” issue was that it has been very difficult to publish a first-author paper from my PhD research work, due to the impact from the development of COVID-19 pandemic for the last two years (my overseas-based collaborators have been hit hard particularly and they were still working on part of the experiments until the first quarter of the year 2021) and hence probably this was the most likely the reason that I did not get final offers in some academic postdoc positions, due to the lack of first-author papers.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sergi Kabrera on Unsplash\n\n\nBecause of all the issues and problems, I’ve still kept my old pharmacist job as my side job while I start on a new journey in learning data science. I’ve tested the water since 2019 and temporarily ceased the learning in 2020 due to the pandemic (I worked full-time in hospital which was also another unforgettable experience of course). From the last quarter of 2021, I’ve made up my mind to go full board with data science (as I can’t see my PhD research work being published any time soon so it’s time to consider a possible change in direction). I thought I’d like to learn about it systematically with some sort of logical structures in the course so that I can understand a basic full picture about it in a reasonably short time (I realise data science itself is a profound field) and if there are some sort of accreditations, this would be even better. This was also the sole reason why I started on Coursera’s IBM data science professional certificate in the last quarter of 2021. After learning more about it, I’ve realised how much it has overlapped with cheminformatics and my interests in both areas grew more and more as time goes.\nI have now completed the data science professional certificate, which consisted of a total of 10 courses with assessments, assignments and portfolios (certificates and/or IBM badges viewable from my LinkedIn profile). I have managed to finish the course within about 5 months (from mid-September 2021 till end of January 2022) while working part-time as a locum pharmacist. Although it’s not a perfect course, I think it reflects very nicely what the reality will be like when working as a data scientist or cheminformatician – imperfections in data sources, data analyses and presentations that need to be corrected or problems that need to be solved by looking for answers and working on possible solutions. I think it’s a useful course for newcomers who want to learn more about data science and also for the professionals who would like to refresh or reaffirm knowledge and skills (this is by no means a promotion about Coursera’s data science course but just a personal learning experience only, other course providers may equally provide similar experiences and I would encourage anyone who’s interested to look around and see what other courses are available)."

This then opened up a whole new R world with its friendly online community. Since my interests in R grew further and further, I’ve been looking for places where I can use RStudio IDE and/or R to build blogs and gladly I found Quarto which led me to its Quarto blogs.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lia Trevarthen on Unsplash\n\n\nSo here is my very first Quarto blog, deployed using Netlify initially and then I also figured out how to deploy it on GitHub Pages, so now I’ve actually got two extra sites running.

I’m still pondering if I should write something on how I started Quarto blogs, but considering so many talented people have already talked about it, I may not go down this route (consider visiting Bea Milz’s lovely post on “Creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps” - this was what I followed to get my Quarto blog up and running).\nI will be slowly moving my current posts and portfolio projects from WordPress to Quarto blogs. Who knows, maybe I may end up working on building websites, or doing other things that I’ve never imagined I would do before!"

    "title": "Pills dataset - Part 3",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe aim of this final part (part 3) for the pills dataset was really for me to start using Rust in a beginner-friendly way. Overall, this trilogy (parts 1 - 3) for the pills dataset formulated an overview of how to use Polars in Python (mainly), Pandas in Python (smaller section) and Polars in Rust (even little less as this was new to me) with Plotly. Over time, I’ve been finding myself learning more optimally by doing and applying, rather than just reading and thinking, so I’ve got myself started in this very new programming language, Rust, to get some familiarities. I anticipated that I would still work with Python and R mainly in the near future, so that I’m not diverting too much and would be at least proficient in at least one programming language.\nMy very initial idea was to integrate Rust-Polars, Plotly in Rust (Plotly.rs) and Jupyter-Evcxr together, and see if I could get a simple data visualisation out of a small dataset. Although the idea sounded simple enough, I was actually quite stuck at the step of importing one of the columns as x-axis variables in Rust-Polars to Plotly.rs. I figured it might possibly be due to my very lack-of-knowledge and lack-of-familiarities with Rust (I do need to continue reading the Rust programming language book), Polars (I’m better with Python-Polars actually), Plotly.rs and also Evcxr. Another possibility could be that Plotly.rs mainly had ndarray support, and Polars was not mentioned explicitly in Plotly.rs so my guess was that these two might not flow very well together. Also, Polars itself was constantly evolving and growing as well.\nSo I’ve decided to leave things as how it would be for now, before I delayed this post any further. If I happened to figure out how to do this in the future, then I’ll come back to update this last part of the project. While I was tackling this little issue mentioned above, somehow I’ve managed to deconstruct Polars dataframe in Rust in Evcxr. So I’ll show a little bit about it below. One slightly good news that came out from all of this, was that I’ve managed to import the other column as y-axis variables, which contained numbers, without problems. I’ve also figured out the Rust code to convert Series/ChunkedArray to vectors in Rust IDEs (e.g. VS Code, and quite a few others). So I did learn a few things while completing this post, and hoped I could expand further on this later.\nNote: I’ve published all Rust code as print-only in Quarto markdown file, since it’s not possible to run them in RStudio IDE (Rust was not supported). So all Rust code were originally run on Jupyter Lab in MacOS, with code outputs being captured as screenshots, which were shown as photos in this post. Here’s the link to the .ipynb file in the GitHub repository for this portfolio website (or alternatively, you could access it from the GitHub icon link at the top of the web page), in case anyone wanted to see the full .ipynb version.\n\n\n\nImport dependencies\nThese dependencies were known as crates in the world of Rust. I’d also like to think of them as libraries or packages we would install or import in Python and R. So this step was necessary before I even started anything decent in Rust. Similar things would also apply to Rust IDEs as well since I’ve played a little bit in VS Code previously.\n```{rust}\n// Set up required dependencies\n:dep ndarray = \"0.15.6\"\n```\n```{rust}\n:dep plotly = { version = \">=0.8.0\", features = [\"plotly_ndarray\"]}\n```\n```{rust}\n// May take a few minutes to load polars crate (might depend on your machine specs)\n:dep polars = { version = \">=0.26.0\", features = [\"lazy\", \"csv-file\", \"strings\", \"dtype-duration\", \"dtype-categorical\", \"concat_str\", \"rank\", \"lazy_regex\", \"ndarray\"]}\n```\n```{rust}\n:dep itertools = {version = \"0.9.0\"}\n```\n\n\n\nImport external crates\n```{rust}\n// Import external crates needed\nextern crate ndarray;\nextern crate plotly;\nextern crate polars;\n```\n\n\n\nSpecify imports or modules required\n```{rust}\nuse ndarray::prelude::*;\nuse polars::prelude::*;\nuse plotly::common::{\n    ColorScale, ColorScalePalette, DashType, Fill, Font, Line, LineShape, Marker, Mode, Title,\n};\nuse plotly::layout::{Axis, BarMode, Layout, Legend, TicksDirection};\nuse plotly::{Plot, Scatter, Bar};\nuse itertools::Itertools;\n```\n\n\n\nReading csv file\nHere, I’ve imported the .csv file saved from part 2 of the project.\n```{rust}\n// Reading .csv file\nlet df = CsvReader::from_path(\"ace_para_count.csv\").unwrap().finish().unwrap();\n```\n```{rust}\ndf\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting columns into ndarrays\nI’ve tested plotting in Plotly.rs after a few trials and errors at the beginning, but luckily I’ve spotted the ndarray support from the Plotly.rs book soon enough to figure out that I could convert the “count” column into a ndarray first, which was shown in the code below.\n```{rust}\n// Switch Polars dataframe into 2D array\n// Ensure \"ndarray\" was added as one of the features for polars under dependencies\n\n/*Example from Polars documentation:\nlet df = DataFrame::new(vec![a, b]).unwrap();\nlet ndarray = df.to_ndarray::<Float64Type>().unwrap();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ndarray);\n*/\n\n//Note: ndarray for numbers only, not strings, so only \"count\" column was converted\nlet ndarray = df.to_ndarray::<Float64Type>().unwrap();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ndarray);\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nDeconstructing Polars dataframe in Rust\nBecause “to_ndarray” was only for numerics and not strings, I ran into a problem trying to figure out how to best import this other “Colour” column into Plotly.rs. This led to my little convoluted journey to work with Polars dataframe in Rust, trying to see if I could convert the “Colour” column into a vector (which might not be the best way to do it, but as part of my Rust learning, I went for it anyway). I’ve subsequently tried plotting the “count” column in ndarray as a vector with success, based on the reference from Plotly.rs book that variables for x or y-axis could be placed into a vector by using a vector macro. Eventually, I didn’t quite achieve my goal but I’ve managed to break down or convert the Polars dataframe into different formats.\n```{rust}\n// Select specific column or series by position\nlet Colours = df[0].clone();\n\n//Alternative way to select specific column or series by name\n//let u = df.select_series(&[\"Colour\"]);\n```\n```{rust}\nColours\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThere was a mention of storing series (column) in a vec (as series vector, not vector for strings) in Polars’ documentation, which I’ve tried to plot in Plotly.rs, but it unfortunately failed to work. One of my guesses could be due to the data type used for vector, as Rust was a very type-specific programming language, which also brought its well-known memory safety and other benefits in the long run. My immediate thought was that it probably needed to be a vector for strings, not series, which might make it work. Then I was searching on StackOverflow for similar questions and answers, then I found something related to what I wanted to do from Polars documentations as shown below.\n```{rust}\n// Adapted from: https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/docs/eager/index.html#series \n// Extracting data: \n// To be able to extract data out of Series, \n// either by iterating over them or converting them to other datatypes like a Vec<T>, \n// we first need to downcast them to a ChunkedArray<T>. \n// This is needed because we don't know the data type that is held by the Series.\n\n/*use polars::prelude::*; \n  use polars::df;\n\n  fn extract_data() -> PolarsResult<()> { \n  let df = df! [ \"a\" => [None, Some(1.0f32), Some(2.0)], \"str\" => [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"ham\"]]?;\n\n// first extract ChunkedArray to get the inner type.\n\n  let ca = df.column(\"a\")?.f32()?;\n\n// Then convert to vec\n\n  let _to_vec: Vec<Option<f32>> = Vec::from(ca);\n\n// We can also do this with iterators\n\n  let ca = df.column(\"str\")?.utf8()?; \n  let _to_vec: Vec<Option<&str>> = ca.into_iter().collect(); \n  let _to_vec_no_options: Vec<&str> = ca.into_no_null_iter().collect();\n\n  Ok(())\n\n}*/\n```\nInitially, I trialled the iterator function first.\n```{rust}\n// Print out items in column by applying an iterator to it\nprintln!(\"{}\", &Colours.iter().format(\"\\n\"));\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThen, it took me quite a long time to just downcast Series into ChunkedArray, but somehow I’ve managed to figure out the code myself below. One of the likely reasons was due to my choice of using Evcxr, which required Rust code in slightly different formats than the ones in Rust IDEs (although almost the same).\n```{rust}\n// Somehow worked out how to convert series to chunkedarray by accident!\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", Colours.utf8().unwrap());\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThen I moved onto trying to figure out how to convert or place a ChunkedArray into a vector, with the closest answer shown below. However, bear in mind that these Rust code were for Rust IDEs, and not for Evcxr, so this added slightly more complexities to what I was trying to do (perhaps I should just stick with Rust IDEs in the future…).\n```{rust}\n//Adpated from StackOverflow - How to get a Vec from polars Series or ChunkedArray?\n//You can collect the values into a Vec.\n\n/*use polars::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() -> Result<()> { let s = Series::new(\"a\", 0..10i32);\n\n    let as_vec: Vec<Option<i32>> = s.i32()?.into_iter().collect();\n\n    //if we are certain we don't have missing values\n    let as_vec: Vec<i32> = s.i32()?.into_no_null_iter().collect();\n    Ok(())\n\n}*/\n```\nI also found another way to iterate the ChunkedArray.\n```{rust}\n//fn iter_forward(ca: &Float32Chunked) { ca.into_iter().for_each(|opt_v| println!(\"{:?}\", opt_v)) } \n```\nI then tested another iterator method, and came up with another line of code as shown below, which listed the colours in the “Colour” column.\n```{rust}\nColours.utf8().unwrap().into_iter().for_each(|array|println!(\"{:?}\", array));\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nI also found out, randomly, how to slice strings for Series in Polars. By changing the number of letters to slice through in Some(), the strings or words would vary length accordingly. Here, I’ve used “15” so it covered all the colours (note: the longest would be 12 characters for combination colours).\n```{rust}\n// Another method to use if needing to slice strings\nlet x = Colours.utf8().unwrap().str_slice(0, Some(15));\nx\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nLastly, before I got too carried away, I just wanted to show the method from Polars documentations that this was the Polars’ way to select a specific column from Polars dataframe.\n```{rust}\nlet ca = df.clone().lazy().select([cols([\"Colour\"])]).collect()?;\nca\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Polars dataframe in Plotly.rs\nFor the x-axis, eventually, I reverted for manual input due to the issue mentioned in the background section. So the colours from the “Colour” column were stored in a vector set up manually, rather than coming directly from the dataframe. While searching for answers, I’ve also learnt several other tricks, although not really solving the problem, they might still be useful in the future. For the y-axis, the ndarray for the “count” column was converted into a vector first before being fed into the trace (graph module), and thankfully the plot worked nicely.\n```{rust}\n// MANUAL method:\n// Use vec! macro to create new vectors to hold x variables (words as strings)\n// Manually input the colour names (as ndarray is only for numbers)\nlet x = vec![\"RED\", \"ORANGE;BROWN\", \"YELLOW;WHITE\", \"ORANGE\", \"WHITE\", \"BLUE\"];\n\n// Plot using ndarray, which is supported by Plotly.rs \n// Polars likely not supported yet\n// Convert ndarray (holding counts as y variables) into vector \nlet y = ndarray.column(1).to_vec();\n\n// Use trace as a graph module,\n// choose type of plots needed for x & y variables called\n// Graph options e.g. Scatter, Line or Bar\nlet trace = Scatter::new(x, y);\n\n// Set plot variable as mutable and initiate a plot\nlet mut plot = Plot::new();\n// Add trace (graph) into the plot variable\nplot.add_trace(trace);\n\n// Specify the specs for plot\nlet layout = Layout::new()\n    // Choose height of graph\n    .height(500)\n    // Name x-axis\n    .x_axis(Axis::new().title(Title::new(\"Colours\")))\n    // Name y-axis\n    .y_axis(Axis::new().title(Title::new(\"Count\")))\n    // Add title of graph\n    .title(Title::new(\"Frequency of colours in acetaminophen (paracetamol) oral dosage forms\"));\n\n// Set the layout of the plot\nplot.set_layout(layout);\n\n// Display the plot in Jupyter Lab format \n// For Jupyter Notebook, use: plot.notebook_display();\nplot.lab_display();\nformat!(\"EVCXR_BEGIN_CONTENT application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\\n{}\\nEVCXR_END_CONTENT\", plot.to_json())\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis last part was the hardest for me to execute out of all 3 parts (it likely took me a good whole week to figure out deconstructing Polars dataframe and trying to work with vectors), as Rust was completely new to me. At one point I thought about jumping back to Python, but I persisted and although I didn’t quite solve the string importation issue, I was somehow happy that I was at least able to see how this programming language could be applied in Polars dataframe library. I also got a taste of using Rust in data visualisations. All I wanted to show was that there were a variety of data tools to use, and knowing your tools of trade would be the most critical when working on different data projects as certain tools would only work the best for certain tasks and scenarios. This warm-up lesson in Rust was quite interesting and I might continue either in VS Code or Evcxr depending on my next topic of interest.\n\n\n\nReferences\nRust programming language book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html\nPolars crate documentations: https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/\nPlotly.rs GitHub repository: https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly (link to the Plotly.rs book can be found in “Converting columns into ndarrays” section)\nEvcxr GitHub repository: https://github.com/google/evcxr"

    "text": "Quick overview\nPart 2 of this project aimed to look at the pills data up close, particularly into the types of dosage forms, colours, shapes and inactive excipients used in oral medications. Plotly was used as the main data visualisation library, which was followed by some text cleaning for a particularly busy column in the dataset. This was then completed with a section in the end to generate a small dataframe, preparing for a simple data visualisation in Rust-Evcxr for the final part of this project (part 3).\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by

which could be one of the options to plot data from Polars dataframes in Plotly, was to call the x-axis and y-axis data directly from the dataframe as shown in the code below.\n\n# scatter plot for colours, dosage forms & drug strengths \nfig = px.scatter(x = df_viz[\"Colour\"], \n                 y = df_viz[\"Dosage_form\"], \n                 color = df_viz[\"Colour\"],\n                 hover_name = df_viz[\"Drug_strength\"],\n                 width = 900, \n                 height = 400,\n                 title = \"Oral dosage forms and colours of pills\")\n\n# Update layout of the plot\nfig.update_layout(\n    # Change title font size\n    title = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 15)),\n    # Centre the title\n    title_x = 0.5,\n    # Edit margins\n    margin = dict(\n        l = 20, r = 20, t = 40, b = 3),\n    # Change x-axis\n    xaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Colours\"\n    ),\n    # Change y-axis\n    yaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Dosage forms\"\n    ),\n    # Edit lengend font size\n    legend = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 9)))\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nWhite was the most common colour, especially after zooming in the plot. Capsule was very commonly used as the oral dosage form of choice in this dataset.\n\n\n\nVisualising shapes & colours in pills\n\nfig = px.scatter(x = df_viz[\"Colour\"], \n                 y = df_viz[\"Shape\"], \n                 color = df_viz[\"Colour\"],\n                 hover_name = df_viz[\"Drug_strength\"],\n                 width = 900, \n                 height = 400,\n                 title = \"Shapes and colours of pills\")\n\n# Update layout of the plot\nfig.update_layout(\n    # Change title font size\n    title = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 15)),\n    # Centre the title\n    title_x = 0.5,\n    # Edit margins\n    margin = dict(\n        l = 20, r = 20, t = 40, b = 3),\n    # Change x-axis\n    xaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Colours\"\n    ),\n    # Change y-axis\n    yaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Shapes\"\n    ),\n    # Edit lengend font size\n    legend = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 9)))\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nCapsule was again the most common oral dosage shape used for pills in the dataset. Common colours included red, brown, blue, purple, pink, orange, green, white and yellow. Combination colours followed these common ones, which had a mixture of a variety of colours used simultaneously, likely to avoid confusions and errors in dispensings or administrations.\n\n\n\nVisualising inactive excipients in pills\nThe messiest part of the data actually lied in the column of “Inactive_excipients”, with numerous different punctuations used inconsistently, such as forward slashes, commas and semi-colons. There were vast quantities of different inactive components used for oral dosage forms. Because of this, I had to spend a bit more time cleaning up the texts in order to find out what were the commonly used inactive ingredients in the end.\n\n# Formulated a separate dataframe with just \"Inactive_excipients\"\ndf_ie = df_new.select([pl.col(\"Inactive_excipients\")])\ndf_ie\n\n\n\n\nshape: (83925, 1)\n\n\n\n\nInactive_excipients\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS LACT...\n\n\n\n\nnull\n\n\n\n\n\"SORBITOL;ASPAR...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\n\n\"LACTOSE MONOHY...\n\n\n\n\n\"FD&C BLUE NO. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"silicon dioxid...\n\n\n\n\n\"CROSPOVIDONE;M...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;C...\n\n\n\n\n\"COPOVIDONE K25...\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"BUTYLATED HYDR...\n\n\n\n\n\"MAGNESIUM CARB...\n\n\n\n\n\"ACESULFAME POT...\n\n\n\n\n\"CROSCARMELLOSE...\n\n\n\n\n\"FD&C BLUE NO. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;H...\n\n\n\n\n\"CARNAUBA WAX;F...\n\n\n\n\n\"CITRIC ACID MO...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;D...\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText cleaning for inactive excipients column\nTo prepare this column for data visualisations, I used Polars’ string expressions (or more commonly known as regex - regular expressions) to try and tidy up the raw texts. When I did the text cleaning in Jupyter Lab initially, the line of code for .str.strip(” ,“) worked, but when I converted the .ipynb file into a .qmd (Quarto markdown) one, and used the same line, it failed to work due to the extra space in front of the comma. However, I got around the error by splitting it into two separate units as space and comma, and it worked without problem. One possible reason would be due to the reticulate package needed to run Python in RStudio IDE, and how Polars dataframe library was relatively newer than Pandas dataframe library, which meant certain features in Polars might not have been taken on board in the reticulate package (only my guess).\n\n# Clean string texts \n# Convert uppercase letters into lowercase ones in the excipients column\ndf_de = (df_ie.with_column(pl.col(\"Inactive_excipients\").str.to_lowercase(\n    # replace old punctuations (1st position) with new one (2nd position)\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \";\", \", \"\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \" /\", \", \"\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \"/\", \", \"\n    # Remove extra space & comma by stripping\n    # In Jupyter notebook/lab -

From what I’ve worked out here, the most frequently used inactive ingredient was magnesium stearate, which was followed by titanium dioxide, and then interestingly “unspecified”, which was exactly how it was documented in the original pillbox dataset at the beginning. I didn’t go further digging into what this “unspecified” inactive excipients might be, as in whether it meant it in a singular or plural forms. So this still remained a mystery at this stage, but if all these oral medications were FDA-approved, we would’ve hoped each and everyone of these pills would be verified in safety, quality and effectiveness before they entered into the market for wide prescriptions.

At the very least, I’ve kind of tried something I’ve planned for, although not looking very elegant yet, with rooms for improvements in the future."

    "text": "Introduction\nAs mentioned in my last project, I’ve tried using Evcxr, which provided a way to use Rust interactively in a Jupyter environment. The name, “Evcxr”, was quite hard to remember at first. It was pronounced as “e-vic-ser” according to the author, which I’ve randomly come across in an online tech interview when I was looking into it. I’ve also sort of worked out a way to memorise its spelling by taking specific letters out of “evaluation context for rust” (which was what it was called in its GitHub repository).\nFor users of Jupyter Notebook/Lab and Python, they might be quite used to the working speed of the cell outputs. However, one thing I’ve noticed when I was using Evcxr or Rust kernel in Jupyter Lab was that the speed of cell outputs was noticeably slower (especially at the beginning while loading all the dependencies required). The speed improved when loading external crates and modules, and generally it was faster afterward.\nDue to this reason (note: I did not look into any other optimising strategies for this and this could be restricted to my computer hardware specs, so this might differ for other users), I think Evcxr was not ideal for a very large and complex data science project yet (however if its ecosystem kept developing, it might be improved in the future). One thing of note was that when I was combing through issues in Evcxr’s GitHub repository, someone mentioned the slow compile time of the Rust compiler, which would have likely caused the snail speed, but knowing that the actual program running speed was blazingly fast, some sacrifice at the beginning made sense to me. Overall, Rust was really a systems programming language with memory efficiency (with no garbage collector), type safety and concurrency as some of its notable advantages.\nBecause of the dependency loading issue in the Jupyter environment, and also knowing there was already a dataframe library built from Rust, I’ve opted to use Polars-Python again for the data wrangling part of this project. This was also accompanied by the good old Pandas library as well (under the section of “Transform web-scraped data into dataframe” if anyone wants to jump to that part to see the code). I then went on to trial using Rust via Evcxr for data visualisation based on a small dataframe by using Plotly.rs. This project would be separated into 3 parts:\n\nPart 1: Initial pillbox dataset loading and web-scraping\nPart 2: Data wrangling and mining for data visualisations\nPart 3: Using Rust for data visualisation\n\nThe main reason I wanted to try Evcxr was that I could see the potential of using Rust interactively to showcase the results in a relatively fast and efficient manner. This meant specific data exploratory results could reach wider audience, leading to more impacts in different fields, in a very broad term. Oppositely, for more specific users such as scientists or engineers, this meant experiments could be carried out in a safe and efficient manner, with test results readily available for future work planning.\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nThis time the dataset was spotted from Data Is Plural, specifically the 2022.11.30 edition. The section I was interested in was the first paragraph at the top, about “Pills”. By going into one of the links provided in the paragraph, this brought me to the Pillbox dataset from the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). The .csv file was downloaded via the “Export” button at the top right of the webpage.\nThis pillbox dataset was actually retired since 28th January 2021, but was still available for educational or research purposes only. Therefore, it was not recommended for pill identifications as the dataset was not up-to-date. Alternative resources such as DailyMed would be more appropriate for readers in the US (as one of the examples). For readers in other countries, local health professionals and resources would be recommended for up-to-date information.\n\n\n\nImporting library & dataset\n\n# Install/upgrade polars if needed

error message actually came up that showed, “…Could not parse ‘10.16’ as dtype Int64 at column 7…”. One way to get around this was to add “ignore_errors” to bypass this error first in order to load the dataset first.

These dosage form code were hard to understand, so once I’ve got the code along with corresponding dosage forms in texts, the web-scraped information would be converted into a dataframe for further data manipulations.\n\n# Uncomment lines below to install libraries needed for web-scraping\n#!pip install requests\n#!pip install beautifulsoup4\n\n\nImport libraries\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\n\nI’ve opted for using Beautiful Soup as the web-scraping library in Python, along with the requests library to be able to make a URL request call to retrieve web information. There were of course many other tools available as well. A caveat to be taken into consideration was that when web-scraping, it was always recommended to check whether the information being scraped were under a specific copyright license and so on. In this case, I’ve checked that the dosage form table link - https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/dosage-forms was from US FDA and it was stated that the information (both texts and graphs) were not copyrighted (unless otherwise stated, for this particular web page, there was nothing stated along those lines), but a link to this webpage should be provided so that readers could access most current information in the future.\n\n\nSend web requests\n\n# Specify URL address with information intended for web-scraping\nurl = \"https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/dosage-forms\"\n# Request the web information via requests library & save under a data object\ndata = requests.get(url)\n\n\n\nParse web content\n\n# Parse the web content from the URL link by using Beautiful Soup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(data.content, \"html.parser\")\n\n\n\nPrint web content\n\n# Print

Set the columns to contain contents under <td> tags by searching all rows\n  col = row.find_all(\"td\") \n    # if columns are not an empty list, \n    # add the texts under columns in specified orders\n    if (col != []): \n    dosage = col[0].text \n    code = col[1].text \n\n# Append each text item into the dosage_form dataframe\ndosage_form = dosage_form.append({\"Dosage_form\":dosage, \"Code\":code}, ignore_index = True)\n\n# Show dataframe\ndosage_form\n```\nThis method might still work currently, however, the newer and recommended methods would be to use the pandas.concat() method as shown below.\n\n\nPandas.concat()\nFirst example:\n\n# Create an empty dictionary\ndict = []\n\n# Create a loop to iterate through html tags from the soup (scraped html content)\n# find all html tags that began with <tr>\nfor row in soup.find_all(\"tr\"):\n    #

So, a little about what I’m working on lately:\n\n\n\nPhoto by RetroSupply on Unsplash\n\n\n\nI’ve started working on an extension project to the rare disease work (recent Python project) by delving further into the natural history of rare diseases by using Orphanet’s data source (having fun working with xml files)\nWith the turn of events lately, I’m now also learning R programming language (which is something I was planning to do much later, but… to do this now is also fine as this’ll keep me on the ball) and surprisingly it is quite similar to Python in some ways but not at all as well\nTableau project most likely needs further work apart from what the dashboard is looking like at the moment (might be still a bit bare) but at the moment, my focus is on above two projects in the meantime. I’ll try to squeeze more time to work on this soon\n\nOther than that, I’m grateful that I can still work on things of great interests and the world is somehow still functioning in its best possible ways – onwards and upwards hopefully."

    "text": "Why this post?\nWell, I’ve always had a thought sitting at the back of my mind about working on a chemistry-related data project. It was partly due to the research saga detailed in another blog post. About two months ago, I thought I will never be able to get anything decent (e.g. first-author paper) published out of my PhD, so I was thinking of going down the route of working on health data science, which was where I could tie in my pharmacist background. Miraculously, the paper actually got published last month, which meant I might have more career options now…\nThe funny thing was that before I knew this paper was coming, I’ve already made up my mind about working on at least one piece of chemistry-related work before leaving it behind completely. Therefore, this was how I got myself started on this post, a small piece of cheminformatics work on molecular similarity for selected COVID-19 antivirals, as taking my first baby step in this field.\n\n\nHeads up\nThis work was coded entirely in Python3 and saved as .ipynb file initially in Jupyter Notebook. It was later converted into .qmd file via CLI1, which was run without problems in RStudio IDE. One thing to note was that all 2D chemical structures or similarity maps did not physically show up in RStudio IDE after code executions, but after file rendering, all of them appeared accordingly in the published version.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by D koi on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 antivirals\nWithout going into too much pharmacodynamic profiles for these antivirals, as that could easily be another blog post, I’ll provide only brief overviews on how these medicines were used mainly in the New Zealand context (may vary for different countries).\n\nnirmatrelvir & ritonavir\nOne of the oral COVID-19 antivirals, marketed as Paxlovid, was indicated for mild to moderate symptoms, or at risk of severe disease. For effectiveness, it needed to be taken within 5 days of symptom onset, otherwise it might not work as expected. As a side note, ritonavir was added like an enhancer agent for nirmatrelvir, due to its known ability to inhibit CYP3A2-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, therefore, by having it also inside the oral tablet, it would ensure that the plasma concentration of nirmatrelvir would be kept at an optimal therapeutic level in vivo, vital for the antiviral effect. One of the well-known downsides for this medicine was that it could cause drug interactions with several other commonly used medications such as dabigatran, or potent CYP3A inducers such as carbamazepine as one of the examples (for full drug interaction profiles, please consult local guidelines). Renal functions was also another important factor to consider when dosing.\n\n\nmolnupiravir\nThis was the other oral COVID-19 antiviral, also indicated for mild to moderate symptoms or at risk of severe disease, and also if the option of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir was unsuitable. It was often selected as an oral alternative to nirmatrelvir with ritonavir to avoid drug interactions. It also needed to be taken within 5 days of symptom onset to reach optimal effect.\n\n\nremdesivir\nThis was administered via intravenous infusion for selected adult or paediatric patients (depends on local guidelines) when they were hospitalised and at risk of developing severe disease. Current consideration for its use would be within 7 days of symptom onset. It was classed as a section 29 medicine, which meant it was unapproved, but could be prescribed on a case-by-case basis by qualified medical practitioners.\n\n\nbaricitinib\nThis was also another unapproved, section 29 medicine, indicated for use in hospitalised patients on a case-by-case basis. It was indicated for moderate to severe disease with renally-adjusted dose via oral or nasogastric route.\n\n\n\n\nSource of dataset\nThe URLs to obtain canonical simplified molecular input line entry systems (SMILES) of all 5 molecules are listed below (there are several different ways to obtain SMILES for molecules, I’ve decided to use PubChem in this case):\n\nPubChem [Internet].

I’ve downloaded all 5 molecules’ SMILES and saved them as separate .sdf files (selected 2D structure option).\nSo I started off with nirmatrelvir with its canonical SMILES retrieved from PubChem. To display a molecule as a 2D chemical structure graphically, an open-source cheminformatics toolkit library, RDKit, was used.\n\n# Generate a RDKit molecule representing nirmatrelvir\nnmt = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CC1(C2C1C(N(C2)C(=O)C(C(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)NC(CC3CCNC3=O)C#N)C\")\nnmt\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a RDKit molecule for ritonavir using canonical SMILES\nrit = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CC(C)C1=NC(=CS1)CN(C)C(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(CC2=CC=CC=C2)CC(C(CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)OCC4=CN=CS4)O\")\nrit\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a RDKit molecule for molnupiravir using canonical SMILES\nmol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CC(C)C(=O)OCC1C(C(C(O1)N2C=CC(=NC2=O)NO)O)O\")\nmol\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a RDKit molecule for remdesivir by using canonical SMILES\nrem = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CCC(CC)COC(=O)C(C)NP(=O)(OCC1C(C(C(O1)(C#N)C2=CC=C3N2N=CN=C3N)O)O)OC4=CC=CC=C4\")\nrem\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a RDKit molecule for baricitinib by using canonical SMILES\nbar = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CCS(=O)(=O)N1CC(C1)(CC#N)N2C=C(C=N2)C3=C4C=CNC4=NC=N3\")\nbar\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay 2D molecules in grid view\nTo display all 5 molecules in a grid view, I’ve saved all separate .sdf files into one .sdf file (e.g. covid_antivirals.sdf). A quick way to do this was via CLI by using one line of code: cat *.sdf > file_name.sdf (replace “file_name” as the actual file name wanted). One thing to be aware of was to make sure which working directory this was saved to, as it needed to be in the same directory as the .qmd file for it to work.\n\n# Save all 5 COVID-19 antivirals as a list in a cpds object\ncpds = [x for x in Chem.SDMolSupplier(\"covid_antivirals.sdf\")]\ncpds\n\n[<rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol at 0x12bdf9b60>,\n <rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol at 0x12bdf9cb0>,\n <rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol at 0x12bdf9d20>,\n <rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol at 0x12bdf9d90>,\n <rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol at 0x12bdf9e00>]\n\n\nWell, this flexible grid view with function to select molecules would be much more useful if there were several thousands of molecules downloaded. I was just basically trialling this as a practice, which turned out quite nicely.\n\n# Display all compounds in a flexible grid view with selection function\nmols2grid.display(cpds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I thought about adding drug names to each molecule, rather than listing their IUPAC3 names, for the sake of easier reading and viewing. One of the ways to do this was to add legend with the drug names in the same order.\n\n# Display compounds in grid view with drug names shown\nDraw.MolsToGridImage(cpds, \n                     molsPerRow = 3, \n                     legends = (\"baricitinib\", \"molnupiravir\", \"nirmatrelvir\", \"remdesivir\", \"ritonavir\"), \n                     subImgSize=(300, 300), \n                     useSVG = True\n                    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity maps\nNow this part was interesting to me and I’ve spent at least a day or two to just try and understand the fundamentals behind this functionality in RDKit. One of the biggest help for me to fully understand this was this paper: Riniker, S.; Landrum, G. A. “Similarity Maps - A Visualization Strategy for Molecular Fingerprints and Machine-Learning Methods” J. Cheminf. 5:43 (2013). It explained the full methodology behind generating similarity map between compounds using molecular fingerprints.\n\n# Build similarity maps between molecules\n# Import additional libraries needed\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Draw import SimilarityMaps\nimport io\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nThe following step was important to ensure a good image of the map was produced for the molecules, by creating a function for “show_png” first, which was used later.\n\n# Binary i/o keeps data as bytes in an in-memory buffer\n# A function that creates a bytes object as an image\ndef show_png(data):\n    bio = io.BytesIO(data)\n    img = Image.open(bio)\n    return img\n\nI’ve randomly set nirmatrelvir as the reference compound. The other 4 molecules were set as test or probe molecules to be compared with the reference compound. So here I’ve compared nirmatrelvir with ritonavir first.\n\n# Create a Draw2D object \"a\" and specify size of 2D image\na = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(500, 500)\n# Produces a similarity map for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir\n# Specify which compounds to compare (reference and probe) for the similarity map\nfig, maxweight = SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapForFingerprint(nmt, rit, \n                                                               # creates a lambda function (anonymous function) for use within SimilarityMaps, \n                                                               # then select fingerprint type e.g. Morgan fingerprint\n                                                               # types of Morgan fingerprint: bit vector (bv, default) & count vector (count)\n                                                               lambda b, c: SimilarityMaps.GetMorganFingerprint(b, c, radius = 2, fpType = 'bv'),\n                                                               draw2d = a)\n\n# Finish drawing Draw2D object \"a\"                                                                                       \na.FinishDrawing()\n# Display similarity map                                                             \nshow_png(a.GetDrawingText())\n\n\n\n\nTo quickly explain how to look at the contour or topographical map in different colours for the molecule:\n\nGreen shades represented a positive difference or where the similarity decreased when the bits4 were removed\nPink shades showed negative difference or where the similarity increased when the bits were removed\nGrey shades meant there was no change\n\nAnother parameter that might allow us to interpret more easily was to obtain the maximum weight (also known as “maxweight” in the code) for the structure comparison between two molecules. Maximum weight could be understood as maximum difference between the reference and probe molecules. By default, maximum weight was capped at 1.0. This function was already built in above code, so to find out the maximum weight or difference for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, simply just use the print() function.\n\n# Max weight between nirmatrelvir and ritonavir \nprint(maxweight)\n\n0.03389096421417358\n\n\nI’ve then saved this particular maxweight result with a different label name (to clearly show which molecules were being compared), for later use.\n\nmol2_rit_maxw_mol1 = maxweight\nmol2_rit_maxw_mol1\n\n0.03389096421417358\n\n\nTo further explain and understand the parameter of maximum weight, this paper by Riniker and Landrum have included a full calculation styled as pseudocode in Python. I have attempted to summarise them in words, along with the code (adapted from the paper), as below:\n```{python}\n# 1. Calculate the fingerprint for reference molecule\nref_fp = calculate_fingerprint (ref_mol)\n\n# 2. Calculate the fingerprint for test molecule\nthis_fp = calculate_fingerprint (this_mol)\n\n# 3. Create an empty weights list\nweights = []\n\n# 4. Calculate original similarity for ref mol & test mol based on Dice similarity\norig_simil = dice_similarity(ref_fp, this_fp)\n\n# 5. Loop over the different atoms present in the test mol\nfor atom in this_mol.get_atoms:\n\n# 5. (cont.) Generate a new fingerprint by calculating new fingerprints without each of the atom for the test mol\n    new_fp = calculate_fingerprint_without_atom(this_mol, atom)\n    \n# 5. (cont.) Calculate new similarity for the ref fingerprint & new fingerprint based on Dice similarity\n    new_simil = dice_similarity(ref_fp, new_fp)\n    \n# 6. The atomic weight will be calculated as the difference between the original similarity and the new similarity\nweight = original_simil - new_simil\n\n# 7. The atomic weight obtained for each loop iteration (for each atom present) will be added up to contribute to the final atomic weight\nweights.append(weight)\n\n# Note: maximum absolute weight is normalised and capped at 1.0\n```\nNext one was between nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir. I’ve renamed “maxweight” to “mol3_mol_maxw_mol1” to reflect this parameter was measured between 3rd molecule (molnupiravir) and 1st molecule (nirmatrelvir).\n\n# 2.

It showed similar trend between these two molecular similarity tests for these known COVID-19 antivirals. In that, nirmatrelvir versus ritonavir showed the largest molecular difference out of all 5 compounds with the highest maximum weight. This was reflected in the lowest TC as the shortest orange bar, which implied a low similarity between the two molecules. Interestingly, between nirmatrelvir and remdesivir, it appeared the maximum weight was lowest of all 5 molecules, but the TC did not quite reflect that (being lower than that for nirmatrelvir versus molnupiravir and baricitinib).\n\n# Set the overall font size to make all labels on graph easier to read\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 10})\n\n# Used nirmatrelvir as reference compound (mol1) and compared it with 4 other antivirals\n# If wanting stacked bar graph:\n#df_ms_new.plot(x = 'Molecules', \n               #kind = 'bar', \n               #width = 0.3, \n               #stacked = True, \n               #title = 'Molecular similarities between 5 known COVID-19 antivirals'\n               #)\n#plt.show()\n\n# Side-by-side bar graph\ndf_ms_new.plot(x = 'Molecules', \n               y = ['Maxweight', 'T_coeff'], \n               kind = 'bar', \n               figsize = (7, 7)\n               )\n# Add title\nplt.title(label = 'Molecular similarities between 5 known COVID-19 antivirals')\n\n# Add caption for graph re. abbreviations of all the molecules compared \n# Import textwrap module\nimport textwrap\nt = \"nmt = nirmatrelvir, \"\\\n    \"rit = ritonavir, \"\\\n    \"mol = molnupiravir, \"\\\n    \"rem = remdesivir, \"\\\n    \"bar = baricitinib\"\nb = textwrap.fill(t, width = 58)\nx = 'Molecules'\ny = ['Maxweight', 'T_coeff']\nplt.text(len(x) / 2, 0, b, ha = 'left', va = 'bottom')\n\nText(4.5, 0, 'nmt = nirmatrelvir, rit = ritonavir, mol = molnupiravir,\\nrem = remdesivir, bar = baricitinib')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne possibility for this difference could be that the maximum weight parameter in the similarity map test was based on Dice similarity (if referring back to the pseudocode for how to calculate atomic weight), but for the other fingerprint generator test, Tanimoto similarity (also known as Jaccard coefficient) was used instead. These two similarity coefficients were actually calculated differently, with their equivalent equations shown below.\n\nTanimoto similarity/coefficient\nTC was the ratio of the number of chemical features common to two molecules (e.g. molecule a and molecule b) to the total number of chemical features in the two molecules. The following equation summarised this.\n\\[\n\\text{Tanimoto coefficient} = \\frac{(a \\cap b)}{(a + b - (a \\cap b))}\n\\]\n\n\nDice similarity/coefficient\nOn the other hand, Dice coefficient described the number of features in common for molecules a and b, relative to the average size of the total number of chemical features present in the two molecules. The weighting factor of 0.5 was shown in the denominator (or can be 2 in the numerator). The coefficient also ranges from zero to 1. The following showed the equation of Dice similarity.\n\\[\n\\text{Dice coefficient} = \\frac{(a \\cap b)}{0.5\\times(a + b)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe code used in this post were heavily inspired by and adapted from the following blogs and website shown below. I’ve learnt a lot from them, and would like to thank the existence of these blogs and website, which are helping readers like me to learn in an open-source manner. I particularly like the clear and concise writing style from P. Walter’s Practical Cheminformatics blog which is easy to follow. Iwatobipen’s is life worth living? blog has shown a very diverse range of cheminformatics tools available for use, and I’m constantly surprised by how many there are from this blog and also the generous sharing of all the code.\n\nP.

Walter and Iwatobipen, and have enjoyed them but never quite got around to write one myself, so finally I did it! Although this post itself was not written in a grand scale, and I would warmly welcome comments for improvements or corrections, I hope to project what I did here in the future, e.g. to apply them to a much larger set of compounds. My very draft thought now is to perhaps trial using ChEMBL database, which is a well-known open-source cheminformatics library.\nAs a little prelude to what other work I’m planning to do, I’ve managed to start learning Rust as well. There is a back story about why I’ve started learning Rust, which I’ll leave as a probable new post in the future if I feel it fits the context of the post. From what I’ve tried so far, only at seedling stage, it’s going to be an even steeper learning curve than Python and R, but I feel it’s going to benefit whatever I’m planning to do consciously or unconsciously in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCommand line interface↩︎\nCytochrome P450 enzymes of 3A subfamily↩︎\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry↩︎\nBits in a bit vector or counts in a count vector are converted from structural features in chemical structures to formulate molecular fingerprints, which subsequently allows a more efficient way to compare chemical structures computationally↩︎\nRanged from zero (lowest similarity) to 1.0 (highest similarity), more on this in the next section↩︎"

    "text": "Machine learning in drug discovery - series 2\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis work was really a continuation of the first machine learning (ML) in drug discovery series, “Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn” (referred to as ML series 1 from here onwards). In particular, I wanted to work on the logistics regression (LR) model, and look into other strategies that I could use to improve it. Last time, I used LogisticRegression() method on the df_ml dataframe (df_ml_pd was the actual dataframe name used in ML series 1, to denote a conversion from a Polars to Pandas dataframe). I’ve not changed any parameters for the LR estimator, which meant everything was kept at default settings. Overall, this was an example of a default prototype of a LR classifer, which most likely would be too simplistic and not really reflecting real-world equivalents, but it sort of helped me to think in terms of a LR and ML context.\nThis time, with a goal of trying to improve the model, I’ve planned to use cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning at least to evaluate the estimator performance. It was also worth evaluating whether LR was the best ML approach for the df_ml dataset, which would likely need to be kept as a separate post to avoid another lengthy read. I also, on the other hand, have had an idea in mind of doing a ML series 3 looking at re-training the model and a final evaluation, which would keep me busy in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn scikit-learn, an estimator is alluding to the variety of ML approaches (as one of my interpretations), which are usually grouped into classification (e.g. naive Bayes, logistic regression), regression (e.g. support vector regression), clustering (e.g. K-means clustering) and dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis). A useful guide to help with choosing the right estimator can be found here. For a full definition of what an estimator is, refer to this link.\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning series - overall plan\nThe overall plan for the ML series for small molecules in ChEMBL database could be visualised through the following flow chart, which was adapted and modified from the section on cross-validation in scikit-learn.

Readers might notice an additional set of data for validation here. One of the biggest reasons to add this validation set was that often overfitting could happen on the testing set with testing data being leaked into the model, due to parameter tweaking until the model performed optimally as desired. By having a validation set of the data, this overfitting problem could be avoided.\nIn general, model training could take place initially on the training set, with the validation set used for first evaluation, which would be followed by a final evaluation on the testing set if the model testing worked as expected. The “cross” part of the cross-validation was the part that described the process of splitting the training data into many smaller number (“k”) of sets, which was also why cross-validation was also known as “k-fold cross-validation”. With the use of k-fold cross-validation, the training set was essentially equivalent to k-1 of the folds of the training data. The trained model would then be validated by using the remaining parts of the training data, which was almost like being used as a testing data to measure the performance of the trained model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn short, cross-validation was commonly used as an out-of-sample evaluation metric, where each observation was used for both training and testing, leading to more effective use of data. It was often used for hyper-parameter tuning to avoid overfitting, where parameters could be optimised via grid search techniques (such as GridSearchCV).\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding LogisticRegressionCV classifier\nSince we’ve used LogisticRegressionCV classifier for the LR models, this meant it would be unnecessary to use GridSearchCV again according to the definition of the estimatorCV as shown below.\nAs quoted from scikit-learn on cross-validation estimator:\nAn estimator that has built-in cross-validation capabilities to automatically select the best hyper-parameters (see the User Guide). Some example of cross-validation estimators are ElasticNetCV and LogisticRegressionCV. Cross-validation estimators are named EstimatorCV and tend to be roughly equivalent to GridSearchCV(Estimator(), …). The advantage of using a cross-validation estimator over the canonical estimator class along with grid search is that they can take advantage of warm-starting by reusing precomputed results in the previous steps of the cross-validation process. This generally leads to speed improvements. An exception is the RidgeCV class, which can instead perform efficient Leave-One-Out (LOO) CV. By default, all these estimators, apart from RidgeCV with an LOO-CV, will be refitted on the full training dataset after finding the best combination of hyper-parameters.\nTherefore, the cross validation part for the LR model was taken care of by the LogisticRegressionCV classifier. However, I wanted to find out more about this particular estimator, so to further dissect LogisticRegressionCV classifer, Stratified K-Folds cross-validator was actually found to be used in its default setting. One of the parameters in the classifier that was closely related to the Stratified K-Folds was the cv parameter. It was a cross-validation generator that could be tuned by providing integers as its equivalent number of folds used. Its default value for LogisticRegressionCV was set as “None”, which was equivalent to and changed from 3-fold to 5-fold in scikit-learn version 0.22.\n\n\n\nHyper-parameter tuning - how parameters affect LR model\nTo explicitly see the details of all the parameters used after the cross-validation, the names and values of these parameters could be checked for the estimator by using the code below.\n```{python}\n# To find the parameters of any ML estimator as suggested by *scikit-learn*\nestimator.get_params()\n```\nIn this example, the LR model built was named LogR. All the parameters used for LogR by the LogisticRegressionCV classifer were:\n\nLogR.get_params()\n\n{'Cs': 10,\n 'class_weight': None,\n 'cv': None,\n 'dual': False,\n 'fit_intercept': True,\n 'intercept_scaling': 1.0,\n 'l1_ratios': None,\n 'max_iter': 100,\n 'multi_class': 'auto',\n 'n_jobs': None,\n 'penalty': 'l2',\n 'random_state': None,\n 'refit': True,\n 'scoring': None,\n 'solver': 'lbfgs',\n 'tol': 0.0001,\n 'verbose': 0}\n\n\nHowever, by showing this set of parameters used by LogisticRegressionCV classifier wouldn’t really tell much about whether any of these parameters were indeed the best ones to fit the model with. So to find out how these parameters influenced the LR model, it was probably best to run a test by using several different parameters on the model to observe the effects. I’ve had two parameters in mind that I thought would affect the confusion matrix at least - cv and random_state parameters after doing some manual trial and errors by changing the cv and random_state values in the code. However, upon reading and digging further in the online information and resource pools, I quickly realised that cv parameter would probably matter more than random_state parameter. This was based on this line from scikit-learn about the LogisticRegressionCV classifer,\nFor the grid of Cs values and l1_ratios values, the best hyperparameter is selected by the cross-validator StratifiedKFold, but it can be changed using the cv parameter.\nSo it appeared that changing cv parameter could affect Cs and l1_ratios values as well. Also from scikit-learn documentation on LR, other parameters that could be tuned were:\n\nsolvers - algorithms used in classifiers\npenalties (or regularisation) - aims to reduce model generalisation errors and regulate or prevent overfitting\nC - controls regularisation or penalty strengths (which would be already taken care of in this case if using LogisticRegressionCV classifier).\n\n\n\n\nSummary table for different penalties supported by different solvers in logistic regression, adapted from scikit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression. Note: only certain penalties and solvers work together, OVR = One-vs-Rest.\n\n\nA few other online projects or tutorials using logistic regression in scikit-learn had also mentioned that logistic regression in general did not have a lot of key hyper-parameters for tuning. Another post I happened to bump into even concluded that better time should be used to link the model results with the actual business metrics instead, rather than trying to use hyper-parameter tuning on the LR model. Nevertheless, I still wanted to see how these parameters would affect the LR model in this case, even if it was of minor significance, so that I would fully understand how all of them would work together, and how tuning hyper-parameters would be like.\nIn order to search and test the LR parameters on the different models that would be generated in the test, I’ve opted to use RepeatedStratifiedKFold as the cross-validation method (which was the default cross-validator method used in LogisticRegressionCV classifier). The “Repeated” version of it would repeat Stratified K-Fold at the stated (n) times. Because of this, GridSearchCV would then be used to exhaustively search for all the best parameters in this case, with the aim to see how the changes in parameters would affect the accuracy scores for each model.\n\n# Re-sampled y variable randomly so that there were same numbers of samples as X variables\ny = np.asarray(df_ml[\"Max_Phase\"].sample(n = 379, random_state =

across all 4 different cv parameters (5, 10, 20, 30), and the best solver was liblinear\nFor Cs = 10, the best accuracy score was 0.699246 for cv = 20 and when solver was set as liblinear\nFor Cs = 50, the best accuracy score was 0.699263 for cv = 5 across all 4 solvers\nFor Cs = 100, the best accuracy score was 0.697930 for cv = 10 across 3 out of 4 solvers only, which were lbfgs, newton-cg and newton-cholesky\n\nIt appeared that for smaller values of Cs, liblinear might be more suitable than the default lbfgs solver. However, for higher values of Cs, e.g. 50 and above, liblinear might not always be the best solver. The values of Cs and cv parameters that generated the best mean accuracy score were 50 and 5 respectively. The best mean accuracy score produced was 0.699263 with a standard deviation of 0.043226. Solver-wise, there were actually 3 other solvers, liblinear, newton-cg and newton-cholesky, along with the default lbfgs that generated the same mean accuracy score and standard deviations while using Cs = 50 and cv = 5. In my initial LogisticRegressionCV model, I used a different value of Cs parameter (at 10), but with the same cv and penalty parameters.\nTherefore, for the next ML series 3, the plan was to re-train the LogisticRegression model with the newly-discovered best parameters and re-evaluate the model to see if there would be any particular differences. Although currently I suspected the differences might be small (which probably also echoed other ML work on different datasets that also used LR), since the accuracy scores generated from this grid search and ML series 1 were very similar. However, the goal of this post was to understand how cross-validation could be used for hyper-parameter tuning to find the optimal parameters to avoid overfitting a ML model, and this was likely more applicable in other ML approaches.\n\n\n\nFinal words\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeel free to skip this final part as this was really me speaking my thoughts out loud about my portfolio lately.\n\n\nI once read a blog post on learning ML, which has suggested to go broadly in topics, then go deep in one of them, which I’ve agreed wholeheartedly as the approach to go about in the tech world, since there are no ways on earth to learn absolutely everything completely (even OpenAI’s ChatGPT has limits - being restricted by the amount and types of input data being fed into the GPT). So, since I’ve branched into 3 programming languages so far, I’ve decided not to expand further into new programming languages for now, to avoid being “half-bucket-full” for everything, I should really narrow down my focus now. To name the 3 programming languages in the order I’ve learnt them, they are Python, R and Rust. In that, I’m most comfortable with Python as that is my first language, then it’s R, followed by Rust, which is almost brand new. I think right now is a good time for me to go deep into an area that has always caught my attentions. So I’ll be concentrating more on ML in my portfolio in the near future.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nscikit-learn documentation - particularly on LogisticRegressionCV classifier and GridSearchCV\nScikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011.\nBruce, P., Bruce, A. & Gedeck P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Quick introduction\nRecently I had the idea of continuing the long COVID exploration and thought that I’ve never tried scraping a PDF before, so by combining these two ideas together, I ended up with this little piece of work as another post.\nA quick heads up: Java should be installed in order for tabula-py to work seamlessly, since tabula-py is actually a Python wrapper for tabula-java. In this case, I’ve relied on Homebrew to install Java, but there are several other different options available online and I’ll leave this open for people who’re interested to explore themselves. Once it’s installed, we can then check for the Java version to ensure it’s installed properly.\n\n# Check the version of Java\n!java -version\n\nopenjdk version \"17.0.4.1\" 2022-08-12\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.4.1+1 (build 17.0.4.1+1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.4.1+1 (build 17.0.4.1+1, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and importing libraries\nThen we would install any libraries needed for scraping table data from PDF, which in this case, I ended up using only one library.\n\n!pip install -q tabula-py\n\n\n[notice] A new release of pip available: 22.3.1 -> 23.0.1\n[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip\n\n\n\n# import read_pdf from the tabula library\nfrom tabula import read_pdf\n\n\n\nData source\nSource of the table was from this journal paper by Healey Q, Sheikh A, Daines L, Vasileiou E. Symptoms and signs of long COVID: A rapid review and meta-analysis. J Glob Health 2022;12:05014. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\n\n\nPhoto by Steve Richey on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\nTable scraping\nFirstly, I trialled scraping the table from page 4 of the journal paper, which only really scraped about half of the table. I then went on to add in another line of code to specify the scraping area1 on the PDF page in inches (this part could be deduced by using the in-built PDF tool).\nOne thing I wasn’t too sure about was that the tabula-py documentation did state that the default = full page, but in fact, it appeared to be not the case (only half of the table showed up). Also, the journal paper I was using had the tables printed in landscape layout (rather than the more common portrait style), so it wasn’t completely clear if landscape version was making this harder or the other way.\n\n#specify the scraping area (top, left, bottom, right)\ntest_area = \"10.05,6.60,10.05,6.60\" \ndf = read_pdf(\"Journal.pdf\", pages = \"4\", area = test_area, guess = False, stream = True, pandas_options={'header':None})\ndf\n\n[                                                    0\n 0   VREIESWEAPROCINHT TSHEME 1:  Healey et al.

I’ve also gone on to read several online resources and looked into tabula-py and tabula-java, it was clearly shown in their GitHub repo that there were existing issues for tables that have merged cells, empty cells or no column lines (which was what I had in this case). All of them tend to result in jumbled or merged rows or columns. It tends to work better if the tables in the PDFs are already in a proper table format i.e. columns and rows marked by lines. Nevertheless, the purpose of scraping the table data was achieved as full data were there after checking, but just not in a clean and tidy state so the next post named, “Long COVID - an update” would take us into the next stage to see what this tabular data would tell us about long COVID (all done in R).\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThanks to Stack Overflow as I’ve managed to find this solution from several different scenarios and comments.↩︎\nor it could be my ignorance to other better methods - please leave a comment as I’d like to learn!↩︎"

    "text": "Background\nThis was another update on the current long COVID saga around the world that I thought to follow up from my earlier work (details in the SQL and Tableau projects). This time the dataset was obtained from another journal paper, which had data collected until July 2021 (the previous paper was only until March 2021). I’ve used Python to extract a table from the PDF of the paper and also Excel to assist with data cleaning. This was followed by using R to analyse and visualise all the data.\n\n\nSource of dataset\nJournal paper by Healey Q, Sheikh A, Daines L, Vasileiou E. Symptoms and signs of long COVID: A rapid review and meta-analysis. J Glob Health 2022;12:05014. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\n\nData scraping from PDF\nThe dataset was scraped from a PDF obtained via PubMed (journal paper source as shown above) by using tabula-py (for details please see this post, “Table scraping from PDF”). Unfortunately I had trouble installing a similar R package remotely after it was archived (tabulizer package with known issues in its GitHub repository) so I trialled tabula-py instead. It worked for scraping all the data from the target table, but the downside was that the scraped data did not inherit the original tabular format on PDF, with columns and rows all jumbled. I’ve discussed a little bit more on the likely reason for this in the blog post link above. So in short, the final scraped table was cleaned in Excel and saved as .csv file, which was then imported as shown below.\n\n\nData inspection and wrangling\n\n# Uncomment below if requiring installations of packages\n# install.packages(\"wordcloud\")\n# install.packages(\"RColorBrewer\")\n# install.packages(\"tidytext\")\n# install.packages(\"leaflet\")\n\nLoading all the required libraries below.

Obviously since I was still quite new to R (started using R in July), I soon ran into a problem as I kept on getting stuck with not having the count() function to actually count unique elements under the co-morbidities column.\nBy looking at the magnified circle on the right in the image below, you would notice a subtle difference in spacing, so yes the culprit was the space1 and once it was removed, count() worked nicely as how it should be. One small downside was that it would also remove the space between the co-morbidity terms e.g. “liver disease” became “liverdisease”, but since it achieved the aim intended to do unique counts on all the co-morbidities, I left it as it was.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the extra space(s) in dataframe\n\n\n\ndf_new %>% \n  # Remove % symbol, numbers and don't forget to remove spaces as well in the column! \n  mutate(Comorbidities = str_remove_all(Comorbidities, \"[:digit:]|[%]|[ ]\")) %>%\n  # Add this line to filter out all the \"NA\"s\n  filter(!is.na(Comorbidities)) %>% \n  # Count the comorbidities in descending order\n  count(Comorbidities, sort = TRUE) \n\n# A tibble: 37 × 2\n   Comorbidities     n\n   <chr>         <int>\n 1 diabetes         14\n 2 hypertension     13\n 3 IHD              10\n 4 asthma            9\n 5 COPD              9\n 6 obesity           9\n 7 CKD               6\n 8 malignancy        5\n 9 dyslipidaemia     4\n10 liverdisease      4\n# … with 27 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nNow we could observe the top 3 frequency of all co-morbidities listed were: diabetes, hypertension and IHD2. These were followed by, unsurprisingly, common respiratory illnesses such as asthma, COPD3, then obesity, and also CKD4, malignancy, dyslipidaemia and so on. These would be considered as high risk factors of developing long COVID symptoms if someone had these co-morbidities present before being infected by the coronoviruses.\n\n\n\nData visualisations\n\nBar graph for hospitalisation rate\nThen a line of code to filter out the results of “NA” under the column of Hospital (%) was added. Most of the cells with “NA” were there to fill the multiple empty row entries for other variables and not for the Hospital (%) column, therefore these “NA”s were removed in this instance. The horizontal bar graph below showed the COVID-19 hospitalisation rate for studies in different countries, presenting a very diverse results between 0% and 100% hospitalisations across all 19 cohort studies.\n\ndf_hosp_icu %>% \n  # filter out all NAs\n  filter(!is.na(`Hospital (%)`)) %>% \n  # plot the bar graph\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Author (country)`, y = `Hospital (%)`)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 hospitalisation rate across different countries\n\n\n\n\nNote: two of the studies were removed from above, these studies were by Chiesa-Estomba (Italy) and Mahmud (Bangladesh), which had “Not stated” recorded under Hospital (%) {ICU (%)} column.

different colours\n\nA known drawback of wordcloud was that the length of a word might influence how big it might appear in the wordcloud, so it was not completely dependent on the word frequencies in a set of texts. Nevertheless, it was one of the ways to get a rough idea about the most common terms cropping up in collected texts. This last part was more like a small exercise for me and also for anyone who might want to try this but did not where to start.\n\n\n\nSummary\nLong COVID had shown a very versatile and diverse range of signs and symptoms, often resembling other known post-viral illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome, the interactive map above would enable readers to see specific long COVID symptoms for selected countries. People with diabetes, hypertension and IHD might have higher risk of suffering from long COVID if they were infected with the coronoviruses. The types of co-morbidities were not limited to these three unfortunately and several other chronic illnesses mentioned above might also contribute to similar risk. The most affected body systems in long COVID were in respiratory tract, ear, nose and throat areas, musculoskeletal parts, gastrointestinal tract and last, but not the least, neuropsychiatric systems which could bring fatigue and memory/concentration issue, or more widely known as the “brain fog”. All of these outcomes also did not vary widely from earlier meta-analyses on long COVID, reiterating the wide health ramifications that COVID-19 could inflict upon global populations.\n\nAcknowledgement\nI have to thank several online resources when I was trying to build the interactive map.

    "text": "Back story\nIt has been a long while since I’ve used R in my projects. Last year during the time when I bravely embraced the role of rotating curator for @WeAreRLadies on Twitter around end of October, I did mention that I wanted to learn Shiny. I haven’t forgotten about this actually. So as promised, here it is, my first Shiny app in R, which is really a very simple interactive web app about small molecules from ChEMBL database. The URL to reach this app, ShinyAppChembl, is at: https://jhylin.shinyapps.io/ShinyAppChembl/. It shows a selected set of physicochemical properties for the curated small molecules in different max phases in boxplot formats. Note: it may take a few minutes to load the plot when first opening the app.\n\n\n\nThe process\nSince I haven’t been using a lot of R lately, I just wanted to document how I approached this Shiny app framework, as part of my self-directed learning for R that started around mid-2022. The first place I went to was not Google’s Bard or OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as I was trying to preempt a scenario where if both of these options were temporarily down, what would I do to learn a new tool. So I visited the Shiny website first, and literally started from the “Get Started” section there, then tried to read through the lessons provided. I gathered a quick overview about the core components within a Shiny app, which were the user interface, server logic and the call to run or create app in the end, and thought to get started from there.\nOne of the most helpful online books called, “Mastering Shiny” had clarified a few coding issues for me. The reactivity section in the book was very useful as well to help with understanding the interactivity concept in the app. The best and also the hardest thing at this stage after reading some of the information was to actually start coding for the app in RStudio IDE, which I did soon after.\n\n\n\nTrials-and-errors\nInitially, I’ve noticed in the gallery section from the Shiny website that some of the basic Shiny apps had plots produced with R code using S3 method - the type with class ‘formula’, such as boxplot(formula e.g. y ~ group, data, and so on). So I started with this first and ended up with a draft version shown below:\n\n\n\nFirst draft app using S3 method in R code to plot boxplots - screenshot taken by author\n\n\n\nI then tried the ggplot2 version, which I preferred to use. However, I kept on hitting a roadblock repeatedly (as shown in the image below):\n\n\n\nSecond draft app using ggplot2 boxplot format - screenshot taken by author\n\n\nI ended up working through this issue of not being able to display the boxplots properly over at least two days, where I tried to figure out how to change the code so that the boxplots would appear as the output in the app. I actually wrote a plot function code (as shown below) before working on the app.R file, in order to trial plotting the boxplots, making sure that the code worked before using it in the app.R file.\n```{r}\ndfBoxplot <- function(var) {\n  label <- rlang::englue(\"{{var}} vs. Max Phases of small molecules\")\n  \n  chembl %>% \n    select(`Max Phase`, {{ var }}) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = `Max Phase`, y = {{ var }})) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(`Max Phase`, 0.25), \n                     colour = `Max Phase`), \n                 outlier.alpha = 0.2) +\n    labs(title = label)\n}\n```\nOnce I made sure this code worked, I transplanted the code into the server section of the app.R file, however it wasn’t that simple obviously. Through the process of more trials-and-errors, I managed to figure out the code for the plot output in the final version, which was not the same as the function code above, but more like this.\n```{r}\n  output$BPlot <- renderPlot({ \n    \n    ggplot(chembl, aes(`Max Phase`, .data[[input$variable]])) +\n      geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(`Max Phase`, 0.25), \n                       colour = `Max Phase`), outlier.alpha = 0.2) +\n      labs(title = \"Distributions of physicochemical properties against max phases\",\n           caption = \"(based on ChEMBL database version 31)\") +\n      theme_minimal()\n    \n    }, res = 96) %>% bindCache(chembl$`Max Phase`, input$variable)\n```\nI then read about the section on “Tidy evaluation” in the “Mastering Shiny” book, which had thoroughly described the problems I’ve encountered (and which I wished I had actually read this section before and not after hitting the roadblock…). So I’d highly recommend new users to read this section and also the rest of the book if Shiny’s also new to you.\n\n\n\nFinal app\nThe final app now looks like this:\n\n\n\nScreenshot taken by author\n\n\n\n\n\nApp deployment\nAfter I got the app working, I looked into where I could deploy the app, since my main goal was to learn and share my work. At first, I went to the Shiny section on the Quarto website to see if it was possible to deploy the app in Quarto. However, after reading through several questions and answers in relation to Shiny apps and Quarto website, it was obvious that it was still not possible yet to deploy the app in an interactive way on Quarto websites (but it was mentioned in Posit community that this was being looked into, so I’m looking forward to the day when we can do exactly that in the future). This means that currently, there will only be an app image showing up in a Quarto document at most. I ended up choosing shinyapp.io to deploy my first Shiny app for now.\n\n\n\nAbout the boxplots\nSince the main goal of this post is more on the process of producing a simple Shiny app for a new comer, I won’t go into the fine details to describe how these boxplots differ between different max phases. Also as a side note, I’m aware that some experts in data visualisations might not really like boxplots in general, but for my case, I’ve got molecules in different max phases where a boxplot is presented for each max phase lining up next to each other. Therefore, in a way, some relative comparisons or differences could be drawn visually in the first glance, although other graph types such as density plots or heat maps might be better options.\nI’ll focus on the “QED Weighted” variable here, as it’s a physicochemical property that has combined several molecular features together as a score (please refer to this post - section: “Some exploratory data analysis” for details about this QED weighted score). For all the boxplots shown when “QED Weighted” is selected from the drop-down box, max phase 4 molecules obviously have higher QED weighted scores in general than all of the other max phases. This is especially clear when comparing the medians between them, with max phase 4 small molecules having a median QED weighted score of more than 0.5, and the rest of the other max phases had 0.5 or below. The higher the QED weighted scores, the more druglike the molecules will be, and for max phase 4 molecules, they are mostly prescription medicines that have already reached approval and are already being widely prescribed. So this makes sense as this is being reflected in the boxplots for these ChEMBL small molecules.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nFinally, I’m quite pleasantly surprised that there is also a Shiny in Python version, which has a Shinylive option to deploy Shiny app interactively in GitHub Gist and so on… I’ll most likely need to read further into this and make this as my next project. This is also a nice break from my recent machine learning projects, which I’ll try to return to once I’ve had enough fun with Shiny!\nThanks for reading."

    "text": "Machine learning in drug discovery - series 1\n\n\n\nBackground\nAs my interests gradually grew for Rust, I realised why so many people said it might be a hard programming language to learn. My head was spinning after reading the Rust programming language book and watching a few online teaching videos about it. I then decided to start from something I was more familiar with, and somehow through various online ventures and searching, I’ve managed to start two projects in parallel. The first one was where I used Polars dataframe library, and the second one would be about using Rust through an interactive user interface such as Jupyter notebook. I’ve anticipated that the second project would take much longer time for me to finish, so I would be tackling the first project for now.\nThis project was about using Polars, a blazingly fast dataframe library that was written completely in Rust with a very light Python binding that was available for use via Python or Rust, so I started using Polars via Python on Jupyter Lab initially, which involved data wrangling, some exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a reasonably larger section on using machine learning (ML) through scikit-learn. The editing and publishing of this post was mainly achieved via RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\nInstall Polars\n\n# To install Polars dataframe library\n# Uncomment below to download and install Polars\n#!pip install polars\n\n# Update Polars version\n# Uncomment the line below to update Polars\n#!pip install --upgrade polars\n\nOnce Polars was installed, the next step was to import it for use.\n\nimport polars as pl\n\n\n# Show version of Polars\n# Uncomment line below to check version of Polars installed/updated\n#pl.show_versions()\n\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nThe dataset, which was purely about small molecules and their physicochemical properties, was downloaded from ChEMBL database and saved as a .csv file. I’ve decided not to upload the “chembl_mols.csv” file due to its sheer size (around 0.6 GB), and also I’d like to stay using free open-source resources (including GitHub) at this stage. I’ve looked into the Git large file system, but for the free version it only provides 2 GB, which at this stage, I think by adding this larger than usual .csv file along with my portfolio blog repository may exceed this limit in no time.\nFor anyone who would like to use the same dataset, the file I used would be equivalent to a straight download from the home page of ChEMBL database, via clicking on the “Distinct compounds” (please see the circled area in the image below). Options were available to download the files as .csv, .tsv or .sdf formats (located at the top right of the page).\n\n\n\n\nImage adapted from ChEMBL database website\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve had the file ready, it would be read via the usual read_csv() method.\n\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"chembl_mols.csv\")\ndf.head() #read first 5 rows\n#df #read full dataset\n\n\n\n\nshape: (5, 1)\n\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\";\"Name\";\"Synonyms\";\"Type\";\"Max Phase\";\"Molecular Weight\";\"Targets\";\"Bioactivities\";\"AlogP\";\"Polar Surface Area\";\"HBA\";\"HBD\";\"#RO5 Violations\";\"#Rotatable Bonds\";\"Passes Ro3\";\"QED Weighted\";\"CX Acidic pKa\";\"CX Basic pKa\";\"CX LogP\";\"CX LogD\";\"Aromatic Rings\";\"Structure Type\";\"Inorganic Flag\";\"Heavy Atoms\";\"HBA (Lipinski)\";\"HBD (Lipinski)\";\"#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\";\"Molecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\";\"Molecular Species\";\"Molecular Formula\";\"Smiles\";\"Inchi Key\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1206185;...\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL539070;\"...\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3335528;...\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2419030;...\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4301448;...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nNow, since this dataset was downloaded as a .csv file, this meant it was likely to have a certain delimiter between each variable. So the whole dataset was presented as strings where each string represented each compound in each row. Each variable was separated by semicolons. To read it properly, I’ve added a delimiter term in the code to transform the dataframe into a more readable format.\n\n# By referring to Polars documentation, \n# use \"sep\" to set the delimiter of

I only wanted to download around 24 compounds from the ChEMBL database first. Unknowingly, I ended up downloading the whole curated set of 2,331,700 small molecules (!), and I found this out when I loaded the dataframe after setting up the delimiter for the csv file, which later led to the file size problem mentioned earlier.\nLoading these 2,331,700 rows of data was fast, which occurred within a few seconds without exaggeration. This echoed many users’ experiences with Polars, so this was another nice surprise, and once again confirmed that Rust, and also Apache arrow, which was used as Polars’ foundation, were solid in speed.\nNow I had the full dataframe, and I wanted to find out what types of physicochemical properties were there for the compounds.\n\n# Print all column names and data types

database website to find out. This took a while and was an important step to take so that I would know what to do when reaching the ML phase.\nI have selected a few physicochemical properties down below so that readers and I could gather some reasonable understandings for each term. The explanations for each term were adapted from ChEMBL_31 schema documentation (available as “Release notes” on the website), or if definitions for certain terms were not available from the documentation, I resorted to interpret them myself by going into “Dinstict compounds” section on the ChEMBL database, where I would click on, e.g. bioactivities, for a random compound in there to see what results showed up and then described them below.\nThe definitions for some of the listed physicochemical properties were:\nMax Phase - Maximum phase of development reached for the compound (where 4 = approved). Null was where max phase has not yet been assigned.\nBioactivities - Various biological assays used for the compounds e.g. IC50, GI50, potency tests etc.\nAlogP - Calculated partition coefficient\nHBA - Number of hydrogen bond acceptors\nHBD - Number of hydrogen bond donors\n#RO5 Violations - Number of violations of Lipinski’s rule-of-five, using HBA and HBD definitions\nPasses Ro3 - Indicated whether the compound passed the rule-of-three (MW < 300, logP < 3 etc)\nQED Weighted - Weighted quantitative estimate of drug likeness (as defined by Bickerton et al., Nature Chem 2012)\nInorganic flag - Indicated whether the molecule was inorganic (i.e., containing only metal atoms and <2 carbon atoms), where 1 = inorganic compound and -1 = not inorganic compound (assuming 0 meant it was neither case or yet to be assigned)\nHeavy Atoms - Number of heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms\nCX Acidic pKa - The most acidic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX Basic pKa - The most basic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogP - The calculated octanol/water partition coefficient using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogD - The calculated octanol/water distribution coefficient at pH = 7.4 using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nStructure Type - based on compound_structures table, where SEQ indicated an entry in the protein_therapeutics table instead, NONE indicated an entry in neither tables, e.g. structure unknown\nInchi Key - the IUPAC international chemical identifier key\nFrom the df.glimpse() method previously, there were a lot of columns with the data type of “Utf8”, which meant they were strings. There were only two columns that had “Int64”, which meant they were integers. A lot of these columns were actually storing numbers as strings. So to make my life easier, I went on to convert these data types into the more appropriate ones for selected columns.\n\n# Convert data types for multiple selected columns\n# Note: only takes two positional arguments, \n# so needed to use [] in code to allow more than two\n\n# Multiple columns all at once - with_columns()\n# Single column - with_column()\n\n# Use alias if wanting to keep

exploratory data analysis\nOne of the columns that jumped out from the summary statistics of the df_dn dataset was the “Targets” column. It ranged from 1 to 1334 targets. Out of curiosity, I went through several places on ChEMBL website to find out the exact definition of “Target”. Eventually I settled on an answer which explained that the “Target” column represented the number of targets associated with the particular ChEMBL compound listed. I then singled out the ChEMBL compound with 1334 targets recorded, it turned out to be imatinib, which was marketed as Gleevec, and was a well-known prescription medicine for leukaemia and other selected oncological disorders with many well-documented drug interactions.\n\n# This was confirmed via a filter function, which brought up CHEMBL1421, or also known as dasatinib\ndf_dn.filter(pl.col(\"Targets\") == 1334)\n\n\n\n\nshape: (1, 32)\n\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\n\n\nName\n\n\nSynonyms\n\n\nType\n\n\nMax Phase\n\n\nMolecular Weight\n\n\nTargets\n\n\nBioactivities\n\n\nAlogP\n\n\nPolar Surface Area\n\n\nHBA\n\n\nHBD\n\n\n#RO5 Violations\n\n\n#Rotatable Bonds\n\n\nPasses Ro3\n\n\nQED Weighted\n\n\nCX Acidic pKa\n\n\nCX Basic pKa\n\n\nCX LogP\n\n\nCX LogD\n\n\nAromatic Rings\n\n\nStructure Type\n\n\nInorganic Flag\n\n\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nHBA (Lipinski)\n\n\nHBD (Lipinski)\n\n\n#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\n\n\nMolecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\n\n\nMolecular Species\n\n\nMolecular Formula\n\n\nSmiles\n\n\nInchi Key\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL941\"\n\n\n\"IMATINIB\"\n\n\n\"GLAMOX|Gleevec...\n\n\n\"Small molecule...\n\n\n4\n\n\n493.62\n\n\n1334\n\n\n4359\n\n\n4.59\n\n\n86.28\n\n\n7\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\"N\"\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n12.69\n\n\n7.84\n\n\n4.38\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"MOL\"\n\n\n0\n\n\n37\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n493.259\n\n\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\n\n\"C29H31N7O\"\n\n\n\"Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c...\n\n\n\"KTUFNOKKBVMGRW...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore other physicochemical and molecular properties in the dataframe, “Max Phase” was one of the first few that drew my interests. So it tagged each ChEMBL compound with a max phase number from 0 to 4, where 4 meant the compound was approved (usually also meant it was already a prescription medicine). Thinking along this line, I thought what about those compounds that had max phase as 0, because they were the ones still pending associations with max phase numbers. By extending on this idea, this could be a good opportunity to introduce some ML to predict whether these zero max phase compounds would enter the approved max phase.\nFirstly, I had a look at the overall distribution of the max phase compounds in this dataframe df_dn.\n\n# Interested in what types of \"Max Phase\" were recorded \n# for the curated small molecules in ChEMBL database\ndf_dn.groupby(\"Max Phase\", maintain_order = True).agg(pl.count())\n\n\n\n\nshape: (5, 2)\n\n\n\n\nMax Phase\n\n\ncount\n\n\n\n\ni64\n\n\nu32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n734633\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n303\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n954\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n441\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick groupby function showed that there were only 954 small molecules approved. Phase 3 recorded a total of 303 small molecules. For phase 2, there were 441 small molecules, followed by 239 compounds in phase 1. There were, however, a total amount of 734,633 small molecules that had zero as phase number (as per ChEMBL_31 schema documentation). Note: these figures were only for ChEMBL compounds with full documentations in the dataset (excluding entries or compounds with N/A or “” (empty) string cells).\nOne of the other parameters I was interested in was “QED Weighted”. So I went further into understanding what it meant, as the original reference was conveniently provided in the ChEMBL_31 schema documentation. The reference paper was by Bickerton, G., Paolini, G., Besnard, J. et al. Quantifying the chemical beauty of drugs. Nature Chem 4, 90–98 (2012) (note: author’s manuscript was available to view via PubMed link, the Nature Chemistry link only provided abstract with access to article via other means as stated).\nIn short, it was a measure of druglikeness for small molecules based on the concept of desirability, which was based on a total of 8 different molecular properties. These molecular properties included molecular weight, ALogP, polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings and structural alerts. Without going into too much details for this QED Weighted parameter, it was normally recorded as a number that ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 being the least druglike and 1 being the most druglike.\n\n\n\nPrepare dataframe prior to running machine learning model\nBefore I got too carried away with further EDA, I wanted to get started on preparing a dataframe for the ML model. A rough plan at this stage was to filter out Max Phase 4 and 0 compounds. Max phase 0 compounds were the ones that were not assigned with any max phase numbers yet, so they would be ideal for use as the testing set. Another main idea was to use “Max Phase” parameter as the target y variable for a LR model, because ultimately stakeholders would be more interested in knowing which candidate compounds had the most likely chance to reach the final approved phase during a drug discovery and development project or otherwise. This would also provide a chance to potentially reduce the amount of resources and time required in such a complex and sophisticated matter.\nThe goal of this ML model was to answer this question: which physicochemical parameters would be the most suitable ones to predict whether a compound would enter max phase 4 (approved) or not? (implicitly, this might also help to predict which max phase 0 compounds would likely enter max phase 4 in the end)\nI’ve then narrowed down the df_dn dataset to fulfill the following criteria:\n\nOnly small molecules present\nMax phase of 0 and 4 only\n\nAnother reason behind choosing only small molecules that had max phase of 0 and 4 was that a confusion matrix could be built in the end to see if the parameters selected would give us a reasonably good model for predicting the outcomes of these small molecules.\nFor now, I’ve chosen the following columns (or physicochemical parameters) to appear in the interim df_0 and df_4 datasets.\n\n# Selecting Max phase 0 small molecules with desired parameters\ndf_0 = df_dn.filter(\n    (pl.col(\"Type\") == \"Small molecule\") &\n

One major advantage of using pipeline was that it was designed to chain all the estimators used for ML. The benefit of this was that we only had to call fit and predict once in our data to fit the whole chain of estimators. The other useful thing was that this could avoid data leakage from our testing set into the training set by making sure the same set of samples were used to train the transformers and predictors. One other key thing it also helped was that it also avoided the possibility of missing out on the transformation step.\nThe example below used the function of make_pipeline, which took in a number of estimators as inputted, and then constructed a pipeline based on them.\n\n# Test pipline from scikit-Learn\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nLR = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())\nLR.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nPipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),\n                ('logisticregression', LogisticRegression())])In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook. On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.PipelinePipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),\n                ('logisticregression', LogisticRegression())])StandardScalerStandardScaler()LogisticRegressionLogisticRegression()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the logistic regression model\n\nAccuracy scores\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\naccuracy_score(y_mp, y_test)\n\n0.6992084432717678\n\n\nThe accuracy score was 0.7 (after rounding up) based on the original data preprocessing method, which meant that there were around 70% of the cases (or compounds) classified correctly by using this LR classifier. Accuracy literally provided a measure of how close the predicted samples were to the true values. One caveat to note was that for imbalanced dataset, accuracy score might not be very informative, and other evaluation metrics would need to be considered instead.\nThe accuracy score shown below was from the pipeline method used previously, which showed a very similar accuracy score of 0.69656992 (close to 0.7), confirming the method was in line with the original preprocessing method.\n\nLR.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.6965699208443272\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion matrix\nNext, I’ve built a confusion matrix based on the model in order to visualise the counts of correct and incorrect predictions. The function code used below was adapted from the IBM data science course I’ve taken around the end of last year. I’ve added comments to try and explain what each section of the code meant.\n\n# Import confusion matrix from scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n# Import itertools - functions to create iterators for efficient looping\nimport itertools\n\n# Function to print and plot confusion matrix\ndef plot_confusion_matrix(# Sets a cm object (cm = confusion matrix)\n                          cm, \n                          # Sets classes of '1s' (Successes) & '0s' (Non-successes) for the cm\n                          classes,\n                          # If setting normalize = true, reports in ratios instead of counts\n                          normalize,\n                          title = 'Confusion matrix',\n                          # Choose colour of the cm (using colourmap recognised by matplotlib)\n                          cmap = plt.cm.Reds):\n    \n    if normalize:\n        cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis = 1)[:, np.newaxis]\n        print(\"Normalized confusion matrix\")\n    else:\n        print('Confusion matrix, without normalization')\n\n    print(cm)\n\n    # Plot the confusion matrix \n    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation = 'nearest', cmap = cmap)\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.colorbar()\n    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation = 45)\n    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)\n\n    # Floats to be round up to two decimal places if using normalize = True\n    # or else use integers\n    fmt = '.2f' if normalize else 'd'\n    # Sets threshold of 0.5\n    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    # Iterate through the results and differentiate between two text colours \n    # by using the threshold as a cut-off\n    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt),\n                 horizontalalignment = \"center\",\n                 color = \"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.ylabel('True label')\n    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')\n\n\n# Compute confusion matrix\nmatrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_mp, labels = [0,1])\nnp.set_printoptions(precision = 2)\n\n# Plot confusion matrix without normalisation\nplt.figure()\nplot_confusion_matrix(matrix, \n                      # Define classes of outcomes\n                      classes = ['Max_Phase = 0','Max_Phase = 1'], \n                      # Set normalize = True if wanting ratios instead\n                      normalize = False, \n                      title = \"Confusion matrix without normalisation\"\n                     )\n\nConfusion matrix, without normalization\n[[139  63]\n [ 51 126]]\n\n\n\n\n\nA common rule of thumb for confusion matrix was that all predicted outcomes were columns and all the true outcomes were rows. However, there might be exceptions where this was the other way round. Four different categories could be seen in the confusion matrix which were:\n\nTrue positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 1 (126 out of 189 samples)\nTrue negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 0 (139 out of 190 samples)\nFalse positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 0 (63 out of 189 samples)\nFalse negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 1 (51 out of 190 samples)\n\nBy having these four categories known would then lead us to the next section about classification report, which showed all the precision, recall, f1-score and support metrics to evaluate the performance of this classifier.\n\n\n\nClassification report\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_mp))\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.73      0.69      0.71       202\n           1       0.67      0.71      0.69       177\n\n    accuracy                           0.70       379\n   macro avg       0.70      0.70      0.70       379\nweighted avg       0.70      0.70      0.70       379\n\n\n\nPrecision was a measure of the accuracy of a predicted outcome, where a class label had been predicted by the classifier. So in this case, we could see that for class label 1, the precision was 0.67, which corresponded to the true positive result of 126 out of 189 samples (= 0.666). It was defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Positive)}\n\\]\nRecall, also known as sensitivity (especially widely used in biostatistics and medical diagnostic fields), was a measure of the strength of the classifier to predict a positive outcome. In simple words, it measured the true positive rate. In this example, there was a total of 126 out of 177 samples (which = 0.712, for True Max_Phase = 1 row) that had a true positive outcome of having a max phase of 1. It was defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Negative)}\n\\]\nThe precision and recall metrics could also be calculated for class label = 0, which were shown for the row 0 in the classification report.\nf1-score, or also known as balanced F-score or F-measure, denoted the harmonic average of both precision and recall metrics. This metric would also give another indication about whether this model performed well on outcome predictions. It normally ranged from 0 (worst precision and recall) to 1 (perfect precision and recall). For this particular classifier, f1-score was at 0.69 (for class label = 1), which was definitely not at its worst, but also could be further improved. It was defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{F1-score} = \\frac{2 \\times (Precision \\times Recall)}{(Precision + Recall)}\n\\]\nSupport, which some readers might have already worked out how the numbers were derived, was the total number of true samples in each class label (reading row-wise from the confusion matrix). The main purpose of showing this metric was to help clarifying whether the model or classifier had a reasonably balanced dataset for each class or otherwise.\n\n\n\nLog loss\nLog loss could be used as another gauge to show how good the classifier was at making the outcome predictions. The further the predicted probability was from the true value, the larger the log loss, which was also ranged from 0 to 1. Ideally, the smaller the log loss the better the model would be. Here, we had a log loss of 0.607 for this particular model.\n\n# Log loss\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nlog_loss(y_test, y_mp_proba)\n\n0.606602645025058\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions and conclusion\nSo here I’ve completed a very basic LR classifier model for ChEMBL compound dataset. By no means was this a perfect ML model as I haven’t actually changed the default settings of scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression() classifier, with examples such as adjusting C, a regularization parameter which was set at ‘1.0’ by default, and also solvers, which could take in different algorithms for use in optimisation problems and normally set as ‘lbfgs’ by default.\nSo with this default LR model, the evaluation metrics demonstrated a LR classifer of moderate quality to predict the approval outcomes on ChEMBL small molecules, with a lot of rooms for improvements. Therefore, I could not yet confirm fully that the physicochemical parameters chosen would be the best ones to predict the approval outcomes for any small molecules. However, I might be okay to say that these molecular parameters were on the right track to help with making this prediction.\nTo further improve this model, I could possibly trial changing the C value and use different solvers to see if better outcomes could be achieved, or even add more molecular parameters in the model to test. I could have also trialled adding more class labels, e.g. making it between max phase 1, 2 and 4, or a mix-and-match between each max phase category. Other things to consider would be to use other types of ML methods such as naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbours or decision trees and so on. To tackle the problem thoroughly, I would most likely need to do an ensemble of different ML models to find out which model would be the most optimal to answer our target question.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nI’ve experienced the fun of ML after completing this project. The idea was to build on what I knew gradually and enjoy what ML could do when making critical decisions. From what I’ve learnt about ML so far (and definitely more to learn) was that the quality of data was vital for making meaningful interpretations of the results.\nHowever, jumping back to present time, I’ll need to work on my second project first, which is about using Rust interactively via Jupyter notebook. At the moment, I’m not sure how long it will take or how the content will play out. I’ll certainly do as much as I can since Rust is very new to me. If I get very stuck, I’d most likely continue on this ML series. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nReferences\nI’ve listed below most of the references used throughout this project.

    "text": "About me & this blog\nPersonally, I was born in Taiwan but was raised in New Zealand since I was a young kid. So practically I’m more like a Kiwi, although to be more precise, I’m more like half-a-Kiwi and half-a-Taiwanese. There was always an East-meets-West fusion element in me, forever. Professionally, I started my career as a pharmacist in New Zealand, and spent several years working at community and hospital pharmacies, across metropolitan and rural areas.\nThen somehow life took me on a detour where I went down the path of doing postgraduate studies. The research mainly focussed on drug discovery and design with medicinal and computational chemistry involved, with numerous hours spent in chemistry (wet) and computer (dry) labs doing experiments. The research work happened in Australia, where I’ve also continued to work as a hospital pharmacist while working on the research projects. Reflecting back, it felt like my brain cells have gone through a major metamorphasis during those years, before I ended up with a MPhil and PhD.\nI’ve then decided to return to New Zealand and the pandemic hit within a few months after (I couldn’t even make it to my PhD graduation in 2020, because it was cancelled due to COVID), which meant most of my original plans after PhD were forced to change. Subsequently, I discovered my more recent interests in the world of data science and analytics. This then led to this blog, which is really my portfolio, on data analytics work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical fields, as I came from these backgrounds with boundless interests. It’ll also be another channel for me to write random personal blog posts detailing my journey in data analytics."
