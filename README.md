# Data-analytics-and-research-blog

As my data journey progresses, I've found a new place for my portfolio blog which is built by using Quarto. I've deployed it to two sites for now:

-   [GitHub Pages](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/)

-   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d3b71cd0-57df-42aa-b0f2-464e901b9359/deploy-status?branch=main)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jhylin-portfolio/deploys)[Netlify](https://jhylin-portfolio.netlify.app)
