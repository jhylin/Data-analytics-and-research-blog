### Data in life blog

#### **Introduction**

This website serves as my portfolio in a blog style on data science or cheminformatics projects that I'm interested in. These projects tend to be heavily infused with pharmaceutical (current) or healthcare (earlier) themes due to my background. Each project will be showcased in a blog post format, published by using Quarto in RStudio IDE. Currently, I'm aiming to post one new project each month if possible. Most of the projects are done in Python with a smaller proportion of posts in R, and also an even smaller proportion in Rust as experiments only.

#### **Code**

All the code used in each post are available in the [posts](https://github.com/jhylin/Data_in_life_blog/tree/main/posts) folder, which contains every blog post I've worked on in chronological order with folder names in ordered sequence and titles reflecting the posts in the website.

#### **Site deployment**

This blog is currently deployed to two different sites, with GitHub pages being the main one:

-   [GitHub Pages](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/)

-   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d3b71cd0-57df-42aa-b0f2-464e901b9359/deploy-status?branch=main)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jhylin-portfolio/deploys)
