# Data in life blog

This blog serves as my portfolio for all the data analytics projects I've worked on, which tend to be heavily infused with pharmaceutical and/or healthcare themes due to my background and interests. Each project will be showcased in a blog post format, published by using Quarto on RStudio IDE. At the moment, I'm aiming to post one project each month if possible. These projects were mainly written using Python and/or R (with my future plan to slowly expand into Rust if possible).

This portfolio blog is currently deployed to two different sites, with GitHub pages being the main one:

-   [GitHub Pages](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/)

-   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d3b71cd0-57df-42aa-b0f2-464e901b9359/deploy-status?branch=main)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jhylin-portfolio/deploys)
