# Data in life blog

This repository holds all the files pertaining to my portfolio blog, which is deployed to two sites:

-   [GitHub Pages](https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/)

-   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d3b71cd0-57df-42aa-b0f2-464e901b9359/deploy-status?branch=main)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jhylin-portfolio/deploys)

This blog serves to be my portfolio for all the data analytics projects I've worked on so far. These projects tend to be heavily infused with healthcare themes due to my background and also what I have always been feeling strongly about. Each project will be showcased in a blog post format, published by using Quarto (each post is saved as .qmd files). At other random times, it will also store some of my personal comments on my data analytics journey.
