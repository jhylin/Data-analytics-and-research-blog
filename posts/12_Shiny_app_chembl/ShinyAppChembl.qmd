##### **Back story**

It has been a long while since I've used R in my projects. Last year during the time when I bravely embraced the role of rotating curator for R Ladies on Twitter (when it was more normal and humane) in the final week of October, I remembered I did mention in my introduction profile that I wanted to learn Shiny. I haven't forgotten about this actually. So as promised, here it is, my first ever Shiny app in action, combining chemistry and web interactive app, I've got myself and perhaps a few others a very simple interactive web app on small molecules from ChEMBL database. I seem to really love the data inside ChEMBL database, as this will be my 4th post on the same dataset, knowing that I can probably do many more things with it to explore. 

The URL to reach this app is at: https://jhylin.shinyapps.io/ShinyAppChembl/ - a selected bunch of physicochemical properties of small molecules in different max phases are presented in boxplot formats.

##### **The process**

Since I haven't been using R often lately, I'd like to document a bit about how I approach this brand new Shiny app framework (for me), as part of my self-directed learnings. This is also a continuation or extension of my self-directed learning on R programming language, starting from mid-2022. This first place I went to is not Google or Bard or ChatGPT (I'm trying to preempt a scenario that if all of these 3 options are down, what would I do in order to learn to use a new tool), but actually the actual Shiny website - https://shiny.rstudio.com/.
