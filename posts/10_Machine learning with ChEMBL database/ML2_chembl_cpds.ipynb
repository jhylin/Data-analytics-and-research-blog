        "This post was really a continuation of the first ML series - \"Small molecules in ChEMBL database\". In particular, I wanted to work on the logistics regression (LR) model, and look into other strategies that I could use to improve it. Last time, I used LogisticRegression() method on the df_ml dataframe (df_ml_pd was the actual dataframe name used in ML series 1, to denote a conversion from a Polars to Pandas dataframe). I've not changed any parameters for the LR estimator, which meant everything was kept at default settings. Overall, this was an example of a default prototype of a LR classifer, which most likely would be too simplistic and not really reflecting real-world equivalents, but it sort of helped me to think in terms of a LR context.\n",
        "\n",
        "This time, with a goal of trying to improve the model, I've planned to use cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning at least to evaluate the estimator performance. It was also worth evaluating whether LR was the best ML approach for the df_ml dataset, which would likely need to be kept as a separate post to avoid another lengthy read. I also, on the other hand, have had an idea in mind of doing a ML series 3 looking at re-training the model and a final evaluation, which would keep me busy in the coming weeks or months.\n",

With the use of *k*-fold cross-validation, the training set was essentially equivalent to *k*-1 of the folds of training data.

Some example of cross-validation estimators are ElasticNetCV and LogisticRegressionCV. Cross-validation estimators are named EstimatorCV and tend to be roughly equivalent to GridSearchCV(Estimator(), ...). The advantage of using a cross-validation estimator over the canonical estimator class along with grid search is that they can take advantage of warm-starting by reusing precomputed results in the previous steps of the cross-validation process. This generally leads to speed improvements. An exception is the RidgeCV class, which can instead perform efficient Leave-One-Out (LOO) CV.

One of the parameters in the classifier that was closely related to the Stratified K-Folds was the cv parameter, which was the cross-validation generator that could be tuned by providing integers as its equivalent number of folds used.

        "So it appeared changing cv parameter could affect Cs and l1_ratios values as well. Also from *scikit-learn* documentation on LR, other parameters that could be tuned were solvers, penalties and C (controls regularisation or penalty strengths, which would be already taken care of if using LogisticRegressionCV classifier). Quite a few other similar online projects using logistic regression in *scikit-learn* had also mentioned that logistic regression in general did not have a lot of critical hyper-parameters to be tuned ([one of the examples](https://machinelearningmastery.com/hyperparameters-for-classification-machine-learning-algorithms/)). Another post I happened to bump into even concluded that better time should be used to link the model results with actual business metrics, rather than trying to use hyper-parameter tuning on LR model. Nevertheless, I still wanted to see how these parameters would affect the LR model in this case, even if it was of minor significance, so that I would fully understand how all of them work together.\n",

        "In order to search and see the variations in the LR parameters, I've opted to use RepeatedStratifiedKFold as the cross-validation method (which was also the default cross-validator method used in LogisticRegressionCV classifier). The \"repeat\" version would repeat Stratified K-Fold at stated (n) times. Because of this, GridSearchCV would be used to exhaustively search for the best parameters in this case, with the aim to see how the changes in parameters would affect the accuracy scores for each model.\n"

So here it is, I'm going to concentrate on using machine learning (ML) in Python, specifically in drug discovery field for a while. I'll continue improving the data analytics aspect, but I'll be placing more emphasis on ML so that I can somehow create some ML experiences for myself, while trying to find a good match in the research data science job market in the pharmaceutical field. I also have a feeling that I may need to venture out into overseas roles in the near future, as these types of roles involving ML and pharmaceuticals are just too difficult to spot domestically.\n",

Boykis, who has suggested to go broadly in topics, then go deep in one of them, which I've agreed wholeheartedly as the approach to go about in the tech world, since there is no way on earth that I will be able to learn everything completely (even OpenAI's ChatGPT has limits - being restricted by the amount and types of input data being fed into the GPT). So since I've branched into 3 programming languages so far, I've decided not to expand further into new programming languages for now, to avoid being \"half-bucket-full\" for everything, I should really narrow down my focus now. To name the 3 programming languages in the order I've learnt them, they are Python, R and Rust. In that, I'm most comfortable with Python as that is my first language, then it's R, followed by Rust, which is almost brand new. I think right now is a good time for me to go deep into an area that has always caught my attentions.\n",
