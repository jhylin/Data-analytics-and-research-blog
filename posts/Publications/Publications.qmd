Throughout my PhD, I've also collaborated with the lab group members and also other research groups in other academic research projects. The following publications[^1] were the ones I was involved in:

[^1]: Not a significantly large number of publications there, perhaps due to the research topics I've chosen, they tend to require months or years to see tangible results... so here is my very humble list as some others may be more productive than me...
