To keep myself somewhat occupied, I'm still working on the Tableau project at the moment (while I'm working towards the end of a Tableau course) and have then added two further projects -- one a Python one about rare disease drugs and the other one using SQL. I've just completed and published the Python one (please see Portfolio section for details) and within this week I'm aiming to start the SQL project. This time I'll not be using IBM Db2 or SQLite, which was what I've used for the course but rather I've managed to install MySQL server and also DBeaver GUI to work on the SQL project. The dataset is still to be decided as I sort of want to integrate the SQL one with Tableau and the latest Python project. I'll have another look again...
