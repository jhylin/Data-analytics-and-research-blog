        "I've now come to a stage to do some more in-depth machine learning work after reading some peer-reviewed papers about it in relation to drug discovery and cheminformatics. Previously, I've only lightly touched on a commonly used classifier algorithm, logistic regression, as the first series in the machine learning realm. Reflecting back, I think I could've done a more thorough job during data preparation stage. So this would be attempted this time.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a few of the papers I've read so far, dated in the recent years of 2021 and 2022, it seemed that traditional machine learning (ML) methods were still indispensible performance-wise, and along with deep learning neural networks, they tend to increase prediction accuracy a bit more. I haven't ventured into the practicality and usefulness of large language models in drug discovery yet. From what I could gather from experienced seniors in this area, they were still very much too novel to be useful, and from what I could imagine, molecular representations in texts or strings probably had already created numerous headaches e.g. standardisations regarding to whether to use canonical SMILES and/or SELFIES or not, and probably compound chiralities and so on. Because of this, I'd be sticking with learning to walk first in the conventional ML area before trying to jog and run actually (plans to work on deep learning in the future).\n",
        "\n",
        "The data preparation was carried out with strong reference to the materials and methods section in this paper: van Tilborg, D. *et al*. J. Chem. Inf.Model. 2022, 62, 5938-5951. There were probably other methods out there, but this was the paper I've read recently that had made sense and relatively easy to follow.\n",

        "This time I've decided to try something new which was to use the ChEMBL webresource client to get data from the scratch (i.e. not from direct file downloads from the ChEMBL website). I found this great online resource about fetching data this way here - reference: TeachOpenCADD talktorial on \\[compound data acquisition(https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T001_query_chembl.html)\\]. The data retrieval workflow used below was mainly adapted from this cited talktorial.\n",
