        "Without going into too much details about vector embeddings (as there are a lot of useful learning materials about it online and in texts), here's roughly how I understand embeddings while working on this post. Embeddings are real-valued dense vectors that are normally in multi-dimensional arrays and they can represent and catch the context of a word or sentence, the semantic similarity and especially the relation of each word with other words in a corpus of texts. They roughly form the basis of natural language processing and also contribute to how large language models are built... in a very simplified sense, but obviously this can get complex if we want the models to do more. Here, I'm trying something experimental so I'm going to convert each ADR for each drug into embeddings.\n"

        "When trying to convert the \"fp\" column into tensors, there is one coding issue I've found relating to the data split step earlier. Each time the notebook is re-run with the kernel refreshed, the data split will lead to different proportions of training and testing sets due to the \"shuffle = True\", which subsequently leads to different training and testing set arrays. One of the ways to circumvent this is to turn off the shuffle but this is not ideal for model training. So an alternative way that I've tried is to use ndarray.size (which is the product of elements in ndarray.shape, equivalent to multiplying the numbers of rows and columns), and divide the row of the intended tensor shape by 2 as I'm trying to reshape training arrays so they're all in 2 columns in order for [torch.cat()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cat.html#torch-cat) to work later.\n"

However this is not the only metric that will determine if a model is optimal for predictions, as I've also noticed that every time there's a different train and test split, the MAE and MSE values will vary too, so it appears that some splits will generate smaller MSE and other splits will lead to larger MSE.\n"
