However, I got around the error by splitting it into two separate units as space and comma, and it worked without problem. One possible reason would be due to the reticulate package needed to run Python in RStudio IDE, and how Polars dataframe library was relatively newer than Pandas dataframe library, which meant certain features in Polars might not have been taken on board in the reticulate package (only my guess).\n"

        "I've decided to keep the dataframe very simple for part 3 as my original intention was to trial plotting a graph in Evcxr only (nothing fancy at this stage), and also to gain some familiarities with Rust as another new programming language for me. Readers might notice that I've opted for a scatter plot here for this last dataframe, and when we finally got to part 3 (hopefully coming soon as I needed to figure how to publish Rust codes in Quarto...), I might very likely revert this to a bar graph, due to some technical issues and being a new Rust-Evcxr user. At the very least, I've kind of tried something I've planned for, although it might not look very elegant yet."
