        "Part 2 of this project aimed to look at the pills data up close, particularly into the types of dosage forms, colours, shapes and inactive excipients used in oral medications. Plotly was used as the main data visualisation library, which was followed by some text cleaning for a particularly busy column in the dataset. This was then completed with a section in the end to generate a small dataframe, preparing for a simple data visualisation in Rust-Evcxr for the final part of this project (part 3).\n",

However, I got around the error by splitting it into two separate units as space and comma, and it worked without problem. One possible reason would be due to the reticulate package needed to run Python in RStudio IDE, and how Polars dataframe library was relatively newer than Pandas dataframe library, which meant certain features in Polars might not have been taken on board in the reticulate package (only my guess).\n"

From what I've worked out here, the most frequently used inactive ingredient was magnesium stearate, which was followed by titanium dioxide, and then interestingly \"unspecified\", which was exactly how it was documented in the original pillbox dataset at the beginning. I didn't go further digging into what this \"unspecified\" inactive excipients might be, as in whether it meant it in a singular or plural forms. So this still remained a mystery at this stage, but if all these oral medications were FDA-approved, we would've hoped each and everyone of these pills would be verified in safety, quality and effectiveness before they entered into the market for wide prescriptions. In the worst case, each therapeutic drug should also have post-marketing surveillance, for long-term safety monitoring.\n",

Readers might notice that I've opted for a scatter plot in Plotly (in Python3 kernel) here for this last dataframe, and when we finally got to part 3 (hopefully coming soon as I needed to figure how to publish Rust codes in Quarto...), I might very likely revert this to a bar graph (in Rust kernel), due to some technical issues (slow dependency loading, and somehow with Plotly.rs in Evcxr, the scatter graph looked more like scatter line graph instead... more stories to follow) and being a new Rust-Evcxr user. At the very least, I've kind of tried something I've planned for, although not looking very elegant yet, with rooms for improvements in the future."
